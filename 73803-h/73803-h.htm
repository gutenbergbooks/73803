<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE WOMAN IN BROWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INSTEAD of the week Drexel had thought
his business would keep him in Moscow,
two days sufficed. They were a pleasant
two days, rich with promise of future profit, and it
was with regret that he settled down in his compartment
of the day express to St. Petersburg. He
would have been glad had his business denied him
a little longer the company of his aunt and his cousin
Alice and the polished Prince Berloff.</p>

<p>Drexel gave little heed to the country through
which his train shrieked and rumbled. And there
was small reason that he should, for the land was
monotonously flat, and made more monotonous by
its vast blanket of sunless snow, beneath which it
had been asleep these two months and which it
would not throw aside with the awakening gesture
of Spring for three long months to come. As far
as the eye could reach there was only this gray-white,
frozen desert—desolate emptiness, save
where forests of spruce and hemlock lifted their
myriad whited peaks toward the sullen sky, or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
distant peasant village huddled low as if shivering
with the bitter cold.</p>

<p>The pictures before his inward eye were far more
interesting than this unvaried panorama unrolled by
the snowbound land of his exile. He had reserved
an entire compartment that he might think uninterrupted,
and as the white miles flew behind him new
visions of fortune, of power, of position, shaped and
reshaped themselves in his rapid incisive mind. He
longed impatiently to be back in Chicago—back
with his uncle in the midst of things!</p>

<p>Running through all his thoughts and visions
was his last talk with his uncle. That talk had risen
from this very business of his coming to Russia.
While in Paris the preceding summer Alice and her
mother had met Prince Berloff, then in France on
a secret diplomatic mission. He was one of Russia’s
greatest titles, Alice one of America’s greatest fortunes,
so the engagement that followed was possibly
pre-ordained. Alice’s mother had written her husband
that she desired to see the country where
her daughter was to be so exalted a figure, and had
declared that they would be perfectly safe, even
though smouldering revolutions did threaten to
flame forth, under the protection of so great a nobleman
as Prince Berloff. But old John Howard
would not permit their visit without a nearer escort;
and since he himself could not leave the great traction
deal which then engrossed him, he had shunted
his duties upon his convenient nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>Drexel had rebelled. He protested against leaving
the traction deal and the other vast interests
his uncle was drawing him into. And on another
ground he protested with even greater vehemence.
He had thought himself in love with his pretty
cousin, and he now urged to his uncle the ironic
incongruity of the rejected suitor being compelled
to escort his inamorata about the land, and among
the honours, of his successful rival.</p>

<p>His uncle had put a hand upon his arm. “See
here, Henry,” he said with brusque affection, “you
don’t really care for Alice, and never did care.
You just thought you did.”</p>

<p>“We’ll pass that. But even if I cared, you would
have turned me down just the same.” His tone
was bitter, for the thing still rankled. “Of course
I realize that your sister’s son is a poor man.”</p>

<p>“No poorer than my son would be, if I had one,
if I had died twenty-five years ago like your father.
In this marriage business, it wasn’t that you haven’t
any money. It was because your aunt—well, you
know as well as I do how keen she was about a
title. But forget all that, my lad. I like you just
as if you were my own boy. And I’m proud of you.
Ten years from now, you’ll be the biggest young
business man in America!”</p>

<p>Drexel gave a dry laugh. “I don’t look much
like that picture at present. What have I got?
Only the little my mother left me!”</p>

<p>And then his uncle had said the great words.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
“Eh, but, boy, you’re only twenty-six; and so far
you’ve just been in training! In training to take
my place when I step out. Your training is over;
when you come back from Russia, your real career
begins—and a big one, too! Oh, your fifty thousand
is nothing”—he brushed it aside with a contemptuous
hand—“but you know you’re coming in for
a good part of what I have and you’re going to
manage the whole pile. One of these princes
may be all right for a son-in-law, but he don’t get
control of my business! The things I’ve spent my
life in building up, I’m not going to have sold, or
ruined by mismanagement. No, sir!”</p>

<p>The old man had brought the flat of his hand
down upon the table. “See here, Henry—forget
your grouch—look me straight in the eye. That’s
right. Now, down in the bottom of your heart,
don’t you know that you’ve got the biggest business
chance of any young fellow in America?”</p>

<p>The keen young gray eyes looked steadily into
the keen old gray eyes. “I do,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“And is there anything you’d like better than to
control great industries—to make millions on millions—to
know that though you don’t live in
Washington you’ve got as big a say-so in running
things as any man that does?”</p>

<p>The young man’s face had glowed, his voice had
rung with perfect confidence. “I’m going to be
all that, uncle. I feel it in me! It’s the dream
of my life!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>And it was about this great future that Drexel’s
thoughts revolved as his train roared onward across
the snow. His ironic duty was all but done. For
three months he had grimly played his part, and
now in two weeks Alice would be Princess Berloff.
Originally the marriage was to have taken place in
Chicago, but the disturbed state of affairs would
not permit the prince to leave his country, so it had
been decided that the wedding should be in St.
Petersburg—and Mr. Howard, set free by a business
lull, was now lunging through wintry seas to
be present at the ceremony. Two more weeks,
and Drexel and his uncle would be speeding back
to Chicago—back to giant affairs.</p>

<p>But some of his business thoughts centred here
in Russia; for, after all, his banishment from
business promised to be a fortunate misfortune.
Drexel had not been in Russia two days before he
had seen the tremendous opportunities the future
would offer capital in this the most undeveloped
of civilized countries. He had begun to project
great schemes—schemes to be inaugurated years
hence, when the success of the Czar or the revolutionists
had given the country that stability necessary
for business enterprise. And it was characteristic
of his energy, and of the way he prepared for distant
eventualities, that he had applied himself to the
study of the Russian tongue the better to fit himself
for these dim-seen Russian successes.</p>

<p>At Bolgoîé his meditations were interrupted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the pause of the express for lunch. The platform
was crowded with soldiers and gendarmes, and
standing about in attitudes of exaggerated indifference
were men whose furtive watchfulness betrayed
them as spies of an inferior grade. At Drexel’s
table in the station dining-room sat several officers
of the gendarmerie, to whom he mechanically
listened. They were discussing the greatest of the
Government’s recent triumphs—the arrest a week
before of Borodin, one of the chief revolutionary
leaders, who immediately following his seizure had
been secretly whisked away, no one knew whither
save only the head of the spy system and a few
other high officials. In what prison the great
leader was held was a question all Russia was then
asking.</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the officers, “if the same prison
only held The White One!”</p>

<p>That was a name to arouse even such indifferent
ears as Drexel’s, for he felt the same curiosity
as did the rest of Russia concerning the person
concealed behind this famous sobriquet. The little
that he knew had served only to quicken his interest.
He joined in the officers’ conversation, but they
could add nothing to his meagre knowledge. The
White One was the great general who planned
and directed the outbursts from the underworld of
revolution—a master of daring strategy—the
shrewdest, keenest brain in the Empire. That was
all. For the rest The White One was shrouded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
complete mystery. To Russia at large The White
One was just a great, invisible, impersonal power,
and to the Czar the name most dreaded in all his
realm.</p>

<p>Back in his compartment, Drexel renewed his
eager planning, and his mind did not again turn
from business till St. Petersburg was but some two
hours ahead, and the short, dull-hued day had long
since deepened into night. He heard a voice in the
corridor of his coach remark that near the station
at which the train had just paused was the great
estate of Prince Berloff. He peered through the
double-glazed window out of casual interest in the
place he knew from several visits. But he could
see nothing but a long shed of a station building and
a few shaggy peasants in sheepskin coats, so as the
train started up he settled back and his brain returned
to its schemes.</p>

<p>A few moments later he became aware that the
portière at the door of his compartment had been
drawn aside. Irritated that anyone should intrude
upon the privacy he had paid high to secure himself,
he looked up. In the doorway stood a young woman,
twenty-two or three perhaps, slender but not too
slender, with hair of the colour of midnight, long
black eyelashes and a smooth dark skin faintly
flushed with the cold. The eyes were of that
deep clear blue that is sometimes given a brunette.
She wore a long loose fur coat of a rich dark
brown, and a cap of the same dark fur, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
carried a brown muff, and over her wrist a leather
bag.</p>

<p>For only an instant did she pause, with the portière
in one hand. Then without a word to Drexel,
who had half risen, she entered the compartment
and took the opposite seat.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>CAUGHT IN THE CURRENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH her chin in one slender, exquisitely
gloved hand, she stared out into the
flying darkness. As for Drexel, not
another thought went to America or to fortune-building.
The moment he had seen that darkly
beautiful figure a thrill had gone through him and
a dizzying something that choked him had risen
into his throat.</p>

<p>Her fixed gaze into the outward blackness gave
him his chance and he was not the man to squander
it. He eyed her steadily, noticed that she breathed
quickly, as though she had hurried for the train—noticed
how white and even were the teeth between
her barely parted lips—noticed again how smooth
was the texture of her skin and how like rich old
marble was its colour—noticed how finely chiselled
were all her features, how small the ear that nestled
up in her dark hair. He wondered who she was,
and what. But who, or what, she was decidedly
a Russian, and decidedly the most beautiful woman
he had seen in all the Czar’s wide realm.</p>

<p>Once he gazed out the window, with the purpose
that he might look back upon her with the freshness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of a first glance. When he turned, it was to give
a start. She was gazing straight at him. And her
eyes did not fall or turn when met by his. She
continued to gaze straight into his face, with those
black-lashed blue eyes of hers, such a blue as he
had never before seen—with no overture in her
look, no invitation, no whit of coquetry—continued
peering, peering, as though studying the very fibre
of his soul.</p>

<p>What her outward eye saw was a figure of lithe
strength, built as the man should be built who had
been his university’s greatest tackle, and a dark-mustached,
square-chinned, steady-eyed face that
bespoke power and one used to recognition and
authority.</p>

<p>Drexel met her gaze with held breath, in suspense
as to what remarkable event this remarkable look
would the next minute lead to. But it led to none.
She merely turned her eyes back into the darkness.</p>

<p>He noticed now that she seemed a little tense,
as though mastering some emotion. But other
things claimed his thoughts above this. He wanted
to speak to her—wondered if he dared; but, despite
that long direct look, despite her walking into his
private compartment, he knew she was not the
woman with whom one could pick up acquaintance
on a train. He saw what was going to happen;
they would ride on thus to St. Petersburg—part
without a word—never see each other again.</p>

<p>The train sped on. At length they neared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
environs of the capital. They stopped at a station
where lay a train from St. Petersburg, then started
up again. It seemed to Drexel that her tensity was
deepening.</p>

<p>“Pardon,” suddenly said a voice at the door.</p>

<p>Both Drexel and the girl looked about. There
stood a big-bodied, bearded man in the long gray
coat of a captain of gendarmes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Drexel curtly demanded in his
broken Russian. The young woman said nothing.</p>

<p>The captain entered. He had the deference
which the political police show the well-dressed
and the obviously well-born, but can never spare
the poor.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said he, “I must examine madame.”</p>

<p>The young woman paled, but her voice rang
with indignation. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>It was a distinct surprise to Drexel that her Russian
was also broken—but little better than his own.</p>

<p>“It is my duty, madame,” returned the officer.
“I am sorry, but I must discharge my duty.”</p>

<p>She rose in her superb beauty and flashed a look
at the captain that made Drexel’s heart leap, so
much of fire and spirit did it reveal.</p>

<p>“Duty or no duty, I shall accept no indignity at
your hands!” she cried.</p>

<p>The officer hesitated. “My orders are my orders,
as madame must know. What I do here I must
do through all the train; no woman can leave till
she has been examined. But I shall go no farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
than necessary. Perhaps madame’s passport will
be sufficient. That, madame knows, she must always
show upon request.”</p>

<p>The young woman’s indignation subsided, and
she sat down and reached for her leather bag.
Drexel had been in Russia long enough to know
this searching of a train meant that something had
happened. And he knew how formidable was this
officer—not in himself, but in what he represented,
what was massed behind him: a quarter of a million
of political police and spies, hundreds of prisons,
Siberian exile, the scaffold, blindfolded death from
rifle volleys.</p>

<p>Both Drexel and the captain closely watched the
young woman. She went through the notes and few
articles for the toilet in the little bag; and then a
look of annoyance came over her face. Drexel’s
heart beat high. He knew what faced the person
who had no passport.</p>

<p>She went through the little bag again—and
again found nothing.</p>

<p>The captain’s eyes had grown suspicious. “Well,
your passport, madame!” he cried roughly. “Or
you come with me!”</p>

<p>Drexel knew she was in danger, and in a flash
he thought of a dozen wild things that he might do
to aid her. But he thought of nothing so wild as
what next occurred.</p>

<p>She looked up from her bag and turned those wonderful
eyes straight into his face—and smiled! The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
intimate, domestic, worried smile that a wife might
give her husband.</p>

<p>“John, dear,” she said in purest English, “that
bothersome passport must have been packed in
among your things.”</p>

<p>Henry Drexel may have been unconscious for
some portion of an instant. But the captain, who
had turned to him, saw never a blink, never a falter.</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps it was, Mary,” said he, and he
reached for his bag.</p>

<p>The world whizzed about him as he went through
the form of searching his suit-case; but he showed
only a perplexed, annoyed face when he looked up.</p>

<p>“We must have left it out altogether, Mary,”
he said, speaking in Russian for the sake of the
captain.</p>

<p>“How provoking!” cried she, likewise in Russian.</p>

<p>But this play-acting, good though it was, was
not enough to counterbalance “orders.” “I’ve got
nothing to do with forgotten passports,” said the
captain. He seized her arm. “You’ll have to
come with me!”</p>

<p>She gave Drexel a quick look. But he did not
need it. Already he was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare touch my wife!” he cried, and
he furiously flung the captain’s hand away.</p>

<p>The captain glared. “I’ll do what—”</p>

<p>“You won’t!” snapped Drexel. He pressed his
chest squarely against that of the officer. “You
dare touch my wife—the wife of an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
citizen—and see what happens to you when I
make my complaint! It will be the worst mistake
of your life! As for this passport business, as soon
as we get to Petersburg I shall fix it up with the
chief of police.” He pointed at the door. “Now—you
leave us!”</p>

<p>The captain looked at the broad-shouldered
young fellow, with the determined face and the flashing
eyes. Looked and hesitated, for Drexel’s
dominant bearing was not only the bearing of wrathful
innocence, but it was eloquent of power to carry
out his threat.</p>

<p>The captain wavered, then broke. “I hope
monsieur will excuse——”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” said Drexel sharply.</p>

<p>The captain bowed and stumbled out. When
Drexel turned the young woman was breathing
rapidly and her face spoke many sensations—relief,
excitement, gratitude, perhaps a glint of admiration.</p>

<p>She gave him that direct gaze of hers and held
out her hand. “Thank you—very much,” she
said simply, in English.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I was rather melodramatic,” returned
Drexel, somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>“You could not have done it better. Thank
you.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe32_5" id="i_016">

</figure>

<p>They sat down and for a moment looked at each
other in silence. Her breath still came sharply.
He was eager to know the meaning of all this; he
was sure she would explain; but he said nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
leaving it to her to speak or keep silent, as she
would.</p>

<p>She saw his curiosity. “You are surprised?”</p>

<p>“I confess it.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry so poorly to reward what you have
done. But I cannot explain.”</p>

<p>He inclined his head. “As you please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said again.</p>

<p>If Drexel had thought this incident was to establish
them at once in close acquaintance, that hope
soon began to suffer disappointment. There was
no lack of courtesy, of gratitude, in her manner;
he was already so far in her confidence that she
dropped her mask of perfect control, and let him
see that she was palpitantly alert and fearful; but
she spoke to him no more than a bare monosyllable
or two. Her fear spread to him. Mixed with his
wonderment as to who she was, and what was this
mysterious danger that menaced her, was a trembling
apprehension lest the captain, recovered from his
intimidation, should reappear in the compartment.</p>

<p>But the captain did not reappear, and they rode
on in their strange, strained silence. When the
train drew into the Nicholayevsky Station in St.
Petersburg, Drexel started to help her from the
coach. She tried to check him, but he had her out
upon the platform before she could say a word.</p>

<p>She quickly held out her hand. “Good-bye,”
she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Good-bye?” he cried in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Yes. We shall not meet again.”</p>

<p>An icy chill swept through him. “Not meet
again! Why, I had hoped that you would let me
come—”</p>

<p>“You cannot come,” she went on swiftly. “And
you must not try to follow me.”</p>

<p>That was the plan that had instantly shot into
his head. “But—” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“You must not!”</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>A look from those blue eyes, straight into his
own. “You will not. I trust you.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head. “I shall not.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye—and thank you,” said she.</p>

<p>He gripped her hand. “Good-bye,” he said.
And he gathered in his last look of her.</p>

<p>But suddenly, when he thought he had lost her,
her hand slipped through his arm—slipped through
it as with wifely habit—and she was saying to
him in a hurried whisper:</p>

<p>“Don’t look back. That gendarme captain is
working this way. I think he’s not wholly satisfied.
I must at least leave with you. Come.”</p>

<p>Again Drexel did not blink. Instantly he was
leading her along the platform, arm in arm, with
the easy manner of four or five married years. In
the open square before the station scores of bearded
drivers, swathed in blankets till they looked like
bulky mummies, were clamorously shouting,
“<i>Isvochtchik! Isvochtchik!</i>” One of these Drexel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
signalled. He was helping her into the little sleigh
when he saw her give a calm, steady look to some
one behind him. Turning, he saw the captain,
for whom a sleigh was drawing up to the curb.
Drexel gave him a curt nod, stepped into the foot-high
sleigh and drew the fur robe about them. The
driver cracked his whip and the horse sprang away.</p>

<p>“After a few blocks you can set me down,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>For even that respite Drexel was grateful.</p>

<p>“Where shall I take my lord?” came over the
driver’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Up Nevsky Prospect,” Drexel ordered.</p>

<p>They turned into bright-lit Nevsky Prospect,
thronged with flashing sleighs, and glided without
speech over the polished snow. After a few moments
she glanced back. She clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“He is behind us!”</p>

<p>He did not need to be told not to turn his head.
“The captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is following us?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is only taking the same direction
by chance. Let us stop a few times. That will
show us.”</p>

<p>Drexel gave the necessary orders. They made
a stop at a fruit store, another at a confectioner’s—but
when she looked back, there, at a distance,
was the captain jogging in their tracks.</p>

<p>“He is following—that’s certain!” she breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“He is suspicious, but hesitates to do anything,
and thinks it wisest to watch us. Apparently there
is no shaking him.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a new idea rushed into Drexel’s head.
He looked down into her face; he tried to speak
steadily—tried to keep his joy out of his voice.</p>

<p>“Do you remember what we told that officer—that
we were husband and wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Till we can get rid of him, our only safety is in
keeping up that pretence. If we make one suspicious
move he will pounce upon us. You and I, we must
stay together.”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. But the danger to you?”</p>

<p>“That? That is nothing!” he cried. “Will
you come with me?”</p>

<p>She looked steadily at him a moment.</p>

<p>“I will come,” she said.</p>

<p>For an instant he considered at what hotel there
was least danger of his being recognized. “<i>Isvochtchik</i>,
to the Hotel Metropole—straight!” he
ordered.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were standing in the hotel
lobby, her arm in his, two porters industriously
brushing the snow off their long fur coats, and a
gold-braided major-domo before them.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Drexel, “you have a room for
myself and wife?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Certainly, sir,” said the bowing major-domo.</p>

<p>“Ah—say two rooms, with a connecting door?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I will show you.”</p>

<p>Drexel followed, and the young woman, with
perfect poise, with a grace that made him marvel,
swept up the stairway at his side. The two rooms
were large, each with a great white-tiled stove filling
one corner from floor to ceiling, with long windows
looking out upon the street—and with, between
the two, the required door.</p>

<p>Were the rooms satisfactory? Entirely so.
Would madame or monsieur desire anything for
their comfort? If they did they would order it
later.</p>

<p>When the major-domo and the porter who had
brought up Drexel’s suit-case were gone, and Drexel
was left standing alone in the larger room with
that brilliantly beautiful creature, he was swept
with a desire that this marriage game they played—a
game involving life and death, and far, far more,
for aught he knew—were not a game at all, but a
reality.</p>

<p>But he mastered himself. It was only a game—and
he had to see the game through to the
end.</p>

<p>“This room will be yours,” said he.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said she.</p>

<p>He stepped to the connecting door and changed
the key to her side of the lock. She thanked him
with a look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Perhaps you would like something to eat?”
he suggested.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>He wanted to remain and talk with her, yet the
situation was such that the suggestion had to come
from her. He hesitated near the door, waiting—but
the invitation did not come.</p>

<p>“I shall put out my light,” he said, “but I shall
not go to bed. If you need me, just call. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she came across the room to him, her
hand outstretched, her dark face glowing.</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I seem unthankful,” she said in
her rich low voice. “I am not. And forgive me
because I can say so little. Perhaps the time will
come when I can tell you all, and thank you as you
deserve. But please understand that I understand,
and that I appreciate, what you have done for me,
and the danger you are now incurring in being here.”</p>

<p>As he looked into her glowing eyes, his words
burst out of their own accord. “I would rather be
here than any place else in the world!”</p>

<p>She flushed slightly under his gaze. “Good-night—”
and she pressed his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said he.</p>

<p>He stepped into the other room, and the next
moment the key turned in the lock.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A LONG JOURNEY THAT WAS SOON ENDED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DREXEL walked to one of the long windows
and gazed down into the bright street
through which those absurd-looking yet
comfortable little sleighs, the winter cabs of Russia,
were still whizzing to and fro. Less than three
hours had passed since the young woman had
entered his compartment, and hardly more than
a quarter since this strange adventure had taken a
new turn by sending them together to the Hotel
Metropole. Dazed, tingling, he began dimly to
wonder what they would do on the morrow, and
what was to be the outcome of it all.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were not to be completed. He
had been in the room no more than a couple of
minutes when a rap sounded at his hall door. He
opened it and there stood a hotel porter.</p>

<p>The porter held out a pad of paper. “Will
monsieur please write his and madame’s name
for the registry?”</p>

<p>Drexel took the pad. She had called him John.
So without hesitation he wrote, “Mr. and Mrs.
John Davis, New York, U. S. A.” As he wrote
he heard the rasping of the lock of the connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
door, and looking about he saw that “Mrs. John
Davis” had entered.</p>

<p>He handed back the pad. “Thank you,” said
the porter. “And will monsieur oblige us with his
and madame’s passports?”</p>

<p>For a moment Drexel stood nonplussed. In the
excitement of the last fifteen minutes he had completely
forgotten one great essential fact—that no
person can stay over night in a Russian hotel, or
sleep as a guest in a private house, without sending
his passport to police headquarters to be registered.</p>

<p>For the moment he knew not what to say. It
was the young woman who saved the situation. She
came forward calmly.</p>

<p>“Our passports are in our bag,” she said in her
broken Russian, motioning to Drexel’s suit-case.
“As soon as we have unpacked, monsieur will bring
down our passports in person.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the porter, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Drexel looked at her in dismay. “I had forgotten
all about passports!”</p>

<p>“So had I. But I thought of them the instant
you left me. I knew what was wanted the moment
I heard the knock.”</p>

<p>“If we only had a passport for you!”</p>

<p>“I had unexpectedly to turn mine over as a
credential to gain admission to—to—a certain
place this afternoon. I had no time to get it back.”</p>

<p>“They have your passport! Can’t they trace
you through that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>She shook her head. “It was a false passport.”</p>

<p>“What can we do now?”</p>

<p>“I must leave, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Then I leave, too!” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“I cannot let you risk yourself further.”</p>

<p>“You cannot prevent me!”</p>

<p>“But you must have guessed that that gendarme
captain is not the only man searching for me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if there are a hundred!” he cried
recklessly.</p>

<p>She looked at him queerly a moment.</p>

<p>“By this time,” she remarked quietly, “I dare
say there are fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand!” he slowly ejaculated, and
stared at her. “Then,” cried he, “all the greater
is your need for passing as an American! They
have a description of you?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they cannot have a clear one.”</p>

<p>He began to pace the room. “What shall we
do?” he asked himself. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused. “I have it. Passports
are not required for travelling on trains. Except
in such rare cases as this afternoon. We shall go
upon a trip—as Americans—one lasting for days,
or till we can think of something better. If any
trouble rises, I’ll bluff it out. Are you willing?”</p>

<p>“It is I who should ask the question of you.”</p>

<p>“Then it is settled!” He was fairly swept out
of himself by the prospect of days spent in her company.
The danger—that was nothing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“But how can we leave the hotel, without its
looking queer?” she asked. “There is your bag,
you know.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not take it. Luckily there’s nothing
about it to reveal my identity. The things in it
we really need I can put in the big pockets of my
shuba,” and he pointed at his great loose fur coat.
“We’ll simply saunter out with the air of going for
a stroll. A bag and anything else we want we can
buy at some little shop.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “And I noticed there was a side
entrance, out of which we might slip without being
seen.”</p>

<p>“Yes. One minute, and we’ll be off!”</p>

<p>He slipped on his shuba, threw open the bag,
stuffed his pockets, then closed the bag again.</p>

<p>“Come now,” he cried, almost gaily, starting for
the door.</p>

<p>“But wait.” He looked at her with a quizzical
smile. “Don’t you think it’s—er—rather nice
for a husband and wife to know one another’s
name?”</p>

<p>She smiled back. “Why yes, it would be a convenience.”</p>

<p>“Well—?”</p>

<p>“You called me Mary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that—”</p>

<p>“My name is Mary Davis,” she said. And for
all that she still smiled, he knew he would get no
other name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Then I’m to remain John Davis, I suppose.
But in my case there’s no reason you should not
know my real name. It’s Henry Drexel.”</p>

<p>At his name the smile faded from her face, and
one hand slowly reached out and caught the back
of a chair.</p>

<p>“Henry Drexel!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“You seem to know it.”</p>

<p>“You are—ah—the American who has been
here as the guest of Prince Berloff? Whose cousin
is going to marry the prince?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She was quite calm again. “Yes, I have heard
of you. That’s only natural, for the marriage has
been much talked about. Shall we start?”</p>

<p>They were at the door, when she stopped him
with a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Something just occurs to me. Would it not
be wiser to learn about the trains before we leave?
We can better regulate our actions then.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I should have thought of that.
I can make inquiries down at the hotel office—as
though I were finding out in advance about trains
for to-morrow or the next day.” He laid aside his
cap and coat. “I’ll be back immediately.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps a dozen minutes since Drexel
had entered the hotel. He strolled coolly enough
down the stairway, but, the lobby gained, it was
only with an effort that he maintained his calm
exterior. Near the desk where he could see all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
who went and came, was the burly captain of gendarmes,
his bearded face still ruddy with the outer
cold. Reciting some story to him stood the major-domo.
Upon the instant Drexel had to alter his
plans.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said to the major-domo, giving
the captain a short nod.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.” The major-domo turned to
him.</p>

<p>“Through some oversight my wife’s passport
was left behind when we threw a few things together
to run up here for a day. I suppose if I make explanations
directly to the police department, there will
be no trouble. I am quite willing to pay.”</p>

<p>“It can be arranged, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“I am tired and do not feel inclined to go out,”
he went on with haughty indolence. “Would you
please, when you get time, get the proper official
on the telephone, explain, and ask him to come
here? My wife is resting now; let him come in an
hour. You can say to him that it will be worth
his trouble.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” said the major-domo, who
surmised this rich American would also make it
worth his own trouble. “Anything else, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Send me the head waiter.”</p>

<p>A porter went scurrying for that functionary.
Drexel half turned away, and the major-domo
resumed his recital to the captain.</p>

<p>“The report says, Captain Nadson, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
woman gained admittance on the pretext of having
an engagement. The servants could not clearly
make out her face, for the light was dim and she
was veiled; but her dress and manner made them
believe her a lady of importance, and they told her
to wait.” Drexel pricked up his ears. “It is certain
she knew he was away, and chose her time accordingly,
and it is certain she must have known the
house well, for she slipped into his study and got
into his private papers. When Prince Berloff—”</p>

<p>“Prince Berloff!” exclaimed Drexel. He saw
Captain Nadson give him a sharp look. Instantly
he was under control. “He came in and found
her?” he queried casually.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the major-domo. “But she fired
two shots at him.”</p>

<p>“Kill him?” Drexel nonchalantly asked.</p>

<p>“No. She did not even touch him. And in
the hubbub, she got away. The report says it was
probably a plot of The White One.”</p>

<p>“The White One!” A shiver crept through Drexel
at that dread name.</p>

<p>“The White One—yes,” nodded the major-domo.
“Obviously a scheme to get some State
papers which were temporarily in Prince Berloff’s
possession. But the young woman failed. I wonder
if they’ll capture her?”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Drexel repeated indifferently.</p>

<p>To the head waiter, who just then appeared, he
gave an order for an elaborate supper that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
be a good hour in preparing. Then he casually
inquired about the trains for the morrow, and
learned that he could get a train for the south of
Russia in half an hour.</p>

<p>All the while Drexel had kept Captain Nadson
in the corner of his eye. He perceived that his
cool front had had its effect; the officer was half
reassured, and plainly was afraid to take any immediate
action lest it might prove a mistake disastrous
to himself. Drexel nodded curtly at the captain
and walked away, feeling that suspicion was rendered
inactive till the police official should arrive upon
the business of the passport. By that time they
would be miles out of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>As he sauntered up the stairway he wore the
same cool, careless front; but within him was turmoil.
How about the story the major-domo had
told? But that, even were it true, that was nothing!
The great thing, the only thing, was that for days
he was to be constantly near the wonderful woman
awaiting him above. It went through him with
a thrilling sweep; and it was with a tense eagerness
such as he never before had felt that he threw open
the door.</p>

<p>But she was not in the room where he had left
her. Nor in the other room. He rushed from
one to the other, looking even into the closets.
There was no doubt of it. She was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE PRISONER OF THE WHITE ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Drexel realized that she was gone, a pang
of dizzy agony shot him through. What
his uncle had said about his liking for Alice
was perfectly true; it had been but a boy-and-girl
affair at its best, never warmed by the least fervour;
and it had been weakly, sentimentally cherished by
him only because no true love had ever come to
show him what thin moonshine stuff it was. But
this was different—a thousand times different!
The danger he had stood in, mortal danger perhaps,
had been nothing to him in his anticipation of days
of companionship with her. That he had seen her
for the first time but three hours before, that she was
an unknown personage to him, that she was hunted
by the police, that the report said she had tried to
shoot his cousin-to-be, Prince Berloff—these things
counted also as nothing.</p>

<p>Shrewd, cool-headed, imperturbable, with such
an eye for the main chance as insured his getting
it—thus was Drexel already widely known in
Chicago. His uncle had more than once remarked
to him in his blunt fashion, “Henry, you’ll never let
your heart boss your brain cells!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>And yet this was exactly what his heart was doing.
He was wildly, recklessly in love!</p>

<p>From the first he realised she must have gone
wholly of her own accord—slipped out by the second
staircase—and slipped out, to face alone what
dangers? And why had she gone? This puzzled
him for several moments, for she had seemed glad
of the refuge offered by the plan of travelling as his
wife. Then suddenly he bethought him of the
instant-long change in her manner when he had
told her his name, and the truth flashed home. She
was afraid of Henry Drexel, and her sending him
down to inquire about the train was but a ruse to
give her a chance to escape him.</p>

<p>Why she should hold him in equal fear with the
police and throw away the aid he was so eager to
give, was a mystery his excited mind did not even
try to solve. It was plain she did not want to see
him, yet his sudden, overmastering love, made
reckless by his loss of her, roused in him one resistless
impulse—to try to find her again. What he should
do when she was found he did not pause to consider.</p>

<p>Putting on his big overcoat and fur cap, and
assuming his best air of composure, he sallied forth
into the hall and descended the minor stairway that
led to the side entrance. That he knows he is on a
wild-goose chase, is no check to the search of a
frantic man. Every bit of sense told Drexel he
would not find her he sought, yet he cautiously
glanced into such side-street shops as were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
open; he scrutinised each woman who hurried
through the bitter cold on foot and the robe-buried
occupants of the tiny whizzing sleighs; he watched
each prowling group of gendarmes to see if they
held her in their midst; he peered in at the doors
of cafes—into poor ones where only tea was
drunk—into rich ones, dazzlingly bright, where
jewelled gowns and brilliant uniforms were feasting
on Europe’s richest foods and wines. But it was
as his sense had foretold. No sight of her was anywhere.</p>

<p>Toward midnight the thought came to him that
it was barely possible she had left the hotel for but
a moment, and that she had returned and was
perhaps in distress because of his desertion. He
turned back toward the Metropole. But as he
drew near it, his steps slowed. He remembered
the dinner he had ordered, the police official he had
sent for; both had doubtless arrived long since and
found him gone. The danger ahead cleared his
mind, and, going hesitatingly forward, he was
pondering whether he should risk himself anew on
so slight a chance of giving aid, when the matter was
decided in a wholly unexpected manner.</p>

<p>As he was passing a street lamp, a young fellow
with a few papers under his arm stepped before him.
“Buy a paper, Your Excellency,” he snuffled,
shooting a keen upward glance at Drexel.</p>

<p>“Don’t want any,” Drexel curtly returned, and
pushed by him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Mr. Drexel?” the young fellow called in a
cautious voice.</p>

<p>Startled, Drexel pivoted about. His interceptor
was perhaps nineteen or twenty, squat of build and
very poorly dressed.</p>

<p>“See here—what do you want?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go back to the Metropole.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be arrested.”</p>

<p>This warning might be intended as a service, and
again it might be a new trap. “How do you know?”
Drexel asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I, and others, have been on the watch for two
hours.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To warn you. We were afraid you might not
understand your danger and might try to come back.”</p>

<p>Drexel stepped nearer. “What do you know
about this?”</p>

<p>“That you went to the Hotel Metropole with a
girl, as your wife—that she ran away—that you
went out to hunt her—that the disappearance of
you both has aroused the police.”</p>

<p>Drexel stared, and in the dim light he could see
that the shivering ragamuffin was grinning at his
mystification. Was there some link between this
lad and the young woman?</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want you to come with me.”</p>

<p>“Go with you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Yes. A description of you has gone to all the
police. Everywhere they are looking for you. You
are safe only if you come with me.”</p>

<p>The young fellow certainly did know a lot; but
when Drexel looked over his poor five feet four
inches, and thought of him as a protector, his suspicion
was all alive. He was in one danger, no
doubt—but it would be foolishness to let himself
be duped into another.</p>

<p>“I’m not so certain I want to go with you. Who
told you to do this?”</p>

<p>“A woman.”</p>

<p>“A woman! Do—do I know her?”</p>

<p>“You do.”</p>

<p>The chance to find the young woman swept for
the moment all suspicious fear aside. “Will I see
her?”</p>

<p>“Maybe.” The young fellow grinned and winked.
“I’ll ask Mary Davis.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>With the young fellow leading the way they worked
about in a semi-circle, that had the hotel as its centre,
till at length his guide thrust Drexel into a dark
doorway.</p>

<p>“Wait here, while I get my comrade; he was
watching the other entrance of the hotel,” he said,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was back, with him a slender
figure of medium height. “This is Nicolai; my
name’s Ivan,” whispered the young fellow. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
threw his newspapers into the blackness of the
doorway. “Come on—we must hurry.”</p>

<p>They walked rapidly through by-streets, Ivan
chattering in a low voice all the time, calling Nicolai
“comrade” whenever he addressed him. Drexel
took close notice of his two conductors by the light
of the infrequent gas lamps. The one called Nicolai
was pale, with regular and refined features and a
soft, thin, boyish beard; he was silent, but there was
a set to his face that made Drexel feel that though
Ivan talked the more, he did not dominate the pair.
Compared to Nicolai, Ivan was something of a
grotesque. He was pock-marked, his large ears
stood flappingly out, his mouth was wide and lopsided
and showed very brown and jagged teeth; his
hair was light and close-cropped, and he had no more
eyebrows than if his forehead had just been soaped
and razored. His eyes were small and had a snapping
brightness, and they flashed in all directions,
watching always for policemen or squads of man-hunting
gendarmes, seeing a spy in that shifty-eyed
cabman waiting for a fare, or that little shopkeeper
who at this late hour had not yet put up his shutters.</p>

<p>They crossed the broad and frozen Neva and
zigzagged through obscure and narrow streets.
Presently they passed through a gateway and crossed
a cobble-paved court with houses vaguely outlining its
sides. At a door at the court’s farther end Nicolai
gave three low raps; the door opened, they slipped
quickly in, and it closed and locked behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>A lighted candle revealed a big brown-bearded
man, who gave Drexel a searching look. “All’s
well, I see,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ivan.</p>

<p>The man silently turned over the candle to
Nicolai and disappeared. “Who is he?” Drexel
asked, as they mounted a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>“The keeper of this boarding-house,” answered
Ivan.</p>

<p>Nicolai unlocked a door. They entered and
crossed to another door, Drexel seeing nothing
of the room save that it was almost bare. This
second door entered and locked behind them, and an
oil lamp with blackened chimney lighted, Drexel
found himself in a square, low-ceilinged room
furnished with a hunchbacked couch on one side,
a bed of dubious comfort on the other, a wooden
table in the centre with a battered and tarnished
brass samovar upon it, three chairs—and that was
all.</p>

<p>“Here we are at last,” said Ivan, rubbing his cold
bare hands. “Now for a bite to eat. I’ll fix the
samovar, comrade. Mr. Drexel, sit down.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Drexel, “I thought you were going
to bring me to—to—Mary Davis.”</p>

<p>“It’s not time for her to come yet,” returned Ivan.
“You’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Drexel that this was a strange place
to meet such a woman, but he brushed the thought
aside. Afire with eagerness as he was, he realised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that there was nothing for him but to command
such patience as he could. So he took one of the
rickety chairs and watched Ivan start the charcoal
going in the samovar, and Nicolai take paper bags
from the sill of the one window and from these
bags take big sour pickles, a loaf of black bread and
a roll of sausage, which last two he proceeded to
slice. Presently the tea was brewed, and Drexel
was asked to draw his chair to the table.</p>

<p>In all his life Drexel had never tasted such uninviting
fare. “I’m not hungry, thank you,” he said.</p>

<p>But the sharp eyes of Ivan read him. “Hah!
Bring out the caviar and the champagne, comrade.
What nine-tenths of the world eats always is too
poor for the rich American to eat once!”</p>

<p>“Is it!” said Drexel. He pulled his chair forward,
seized a chunk of the sausage and a slab of the black
bread, and filled his mouth with a huge bite from
each.</p>

<p>Ivan clapped him on the shoulder. “That’s
right!” said he, through his gag of bread and meat.
“Either I like a man, or I want to fight him. Come—let’s
be friends while we’re together!”</p>

<p>Drexel smiled amusedly at the bristling, excited
little fellow, and took the outstretched hand. “All
right. Since you know who I am, you might tell
me who you are.”</p>

<p>“You already know we’re revolutionists,” said
Ivan in his rapid, choppy way. “We’re fighters
for freedom—hey, comrade? Down with Autocracy!—on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
come that glorious day when there’ll
be a chance for every man! Hey, comrade?”</p>

<p>Nicolai nodded.</p>

<p>“But,” said Drexel, “that doesn’t tell me who
you are personally.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you want to be introduced!” Ivan sprang
up, a hunk of bread in one hand and of sausage
in the other, and his little eyes gleamed with a wild,
humorous twinkle. “Allow me to present myself”—he
bowed low, the hand with the sausage to his
heart—“Ivan, the son of I don’t know who,
cradled in the gutter, rocked to sleep on the toe of
a policeman’s boot, schooled with the dogs, my
income the luxurious sum of 60 kopeks a day drawn
from my stock in a lace factory. Glad to meet me,
hey?”</p>

<p>He grinned lopsidedly at Drexel. “That’s me,”
he nodded. “But with Nicolai”—his sausaged
hand made a wave toward his comrade—“it’s
another story. He’s educated—he was rich—he—but
tell him, comrade.”</p>

<p>“Do,” urged Drexel.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the other with his quiet shrug;
“but it’s little more than Ivan’s story. My
parents were well-to-do, yes—but very conservative.
While I was in the gymnasium preparing for the
university, all the country became excited about
gaining freedom. I was loyal enough to the Czar
at that time, for I was only seventeen and had been
shielded by my parents from liberal opinions. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
I was caught by the general spirit and took part in
a meeting of the students to demand a constitution.
Several of us were arrested and exiled to Siberia.”</p>

<p>“Been sent to Siberia! Think of that!” cried
Ivan proudly, and half envious of the distinction
of his friend. Then his tone changed to fierce hatred.
“Think of exiling a schoolboy—and for that!”
His brown teeth clenched.</p>

<p>“But it did me good,” went on Nicolai’s quiet
voice. “I wasn’t a revolutionist before, but that
made me one. After six months I managed to
escape, and came back, and——”</p>

<p>“And then we met each other,” broke in Ivan.
“And ever since we’ve been brothers. Hey,
comrade?” And in an instant he was skipping
nimbly about the table patting Nicolai affectionately
on the shoulder. But the next instant he was talking
again to Drexel. “We’re always together, we two,
both lace-makers—The Inséparables they call us.
Oh, and what a lot he knows! Me, I only know this!”</p>

<p>Instantly he had whipped out a big pistol and was
flourishing it in the air. “That’s the only argument
that will ever win us liberty”—lovingly patting
the black chamber of the weapon. “The Duma—bah!
We’ve got to fight—to die!”</p>

<p>The pocked-marked little fellow began excitedly
to pace the low room, a chunk of sausage in one
hand, the pistol in the other. Nicolai quietly filled
himself another glass of tea. Now that there was
no speech for a few moments the purpose of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
being here came again to the fore of Drexel’s mind.
He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“It’s one o’clock,” he said. “Are you sure she
is coming?”</p>

<p>Ivan glanced at Nicolai. “You must have
patience,” answered Nicolai.</p>

<p>Drexel’s burning curiosity could not refrain from
a question concerning this woman that he loved.
“You know her?”</p>

<p>Both nodded.</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me about her—anything,
that is, you don’t object to telling?”</p>

<p>“I don’t object to telling you everything we know,”
said Nicolai. “We are comrades. We have met
a few times. As for her personality, you know that
as well as we do. That is all.”</p>

<p>“All!” exclaimed Drexel in disappointment. But
he saw that Nicolai was speaking the truth. The
story he had heard the major-domo tell came back
to his mind. “Then you do not know what her
mission was?”</p>

<p>“No. We are only privates. We obey the orders
that are given us.”</p>

<p>“Then she is something more than a private?”</p>

<p>Nicolai nodded.</p>

<p>Time ticked on. Drexel became restless with
the suspense of waiting; then his first thought on
entering the shabby room, that this was a strange
place to meet such a woman, began to grow into a
vague suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>There was a little intermittent talk. More time
dragged on. He grew more restless and suspicious.
At length he rose and drew on his coat. Instinctively
his hand slipped into one of the coat’s outside pockets
and gripped the pistol there.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll walk around a bit,” he said.</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised the quiet voice of Nicolai.
“You know the police are looking for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid.” The thought rose that,
once out of here, his wisest course would be to make
a quick dash for the Hotel Europe where were staying
his aunt and cousin. Once there, the police would
never suspect the relative-to-be of Prince Berloff,
and in no danger from them he could continue his
search for the young woman. “She may be here
when I get back,” he added easily to Nicolai, and
turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“Ivan!” snapped out the voice of Nicolai.</p>

<p>But Ivan was already at the door, his back against
it, and pointing at Drexel was Ivan’s big revolver.</p>

<p>Drexel started to jerk out his own pistol.</p>

<p>“Move that hand, and he’ll shoot!” said the sharp
voice of Nicolai.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know when a man has the drop on me,”
said Drexel. “What do you want?”</p>

<p>“First, your pistol,” said Nicolai, and himself
took it from Drexel’s overcoat pocket.</p>

<p>When Ivan saw the black compact weapon, his
eyes shone enviously. “A Browning!” he cried.
“What a beauty!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“What does this mean?” demanded Drexel.</p>

<p>“That you are going to stay here,” said Nicolai.</p>

<p>“A prisoner?”</p>

<p>“A prisoner.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“That we were not told when the order was given
us,” said Nicolai.</p>

<p>“Then I am being held at some one’s order?”
demanded Drexel.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“By whose order?”</p>

<p>“By the order of The White One,” said Nicolai.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE HOUSE IN THREE SAINTS’ COURT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“BY order of The White One!” Drexel repeated—and
the name of that great, impersonal,
hidden leader went through him with a
thrill of awed consternation. This was a serious
situation indeed! He looked from the quiet, tense
Nicolai, to the gleaming-eyed, alert Ivan.</p>

<p>“So I am the prisoner of The White One?”</p>

<p>They nodded.</p>

<p>“But why? What have I done?”</p>

<p>“I have already said we do not know,” returned
Nicolai. “We have merely done what we were
told.”</p>

<p>Drexel’s poise began to return to him. He took
off his shuba and tossed it upon the crookbacked
couch.</p>

<p>“All right, boys,” he said drily. “Just as you say.
It’s a rule of my life to be obliging to the man who’s
got the drop on me.”</p>

<p>“Will you be quiet, or”—Nicolai motioned
toward a few pieces of rope in a corner.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be quiet—for the present.” He sat
down. “By the way—who is this White One?”</p>

<p>“We do not know,” said Nicolai. “We have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
seen him. Our orders came through a second
person.”</p>

<p>Ivan moved from the door across to Nicolai,
begged Drexel’s Browning pistol with a mute look,
and gave in exchange the big revolver. “That was
really Nicolai’s, but he let me carry it,” he explained
to Drexel. He patted the black, fearsome weapon,
his face glowing on Nicolai. “Ah, comrade, what
a beauty!”</p>

<p>Suddenly Drexel leaned back and roared with
laughter. That he should on the one hand be
searched for by the police, and on the other hand
be held prisoner by the revolutionists—the absurdity
of the situation was too much for him. And the
situation seemed all the more absurd as he considered
the personality of his captors—two starveling,
threadbare lads. Yet even as he laughed he did
not forget the grimness of his state—the prey of
both contending parties. And ere his humour had
subsided, he was beginning to rate his guards a
little higher; for Ivan, hunched up on the floor with
his back to the door, Drexel’s weapon on his knees,
was as watchful as a terrier, and there was a high and
purposeful determination in Nicolai’s pale face that
could but command respect.</p>

<p>It was a quality of Drexel’s, one of the several
on which his uncle based his predictions of his
nephew’s business success, that when in a plight
where he could not help himself, he could easily
throw off all strength-exhausting thought and worry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
He now stretched himself on the sofa, whose bones
all painfully protruded through its starved skin,
and drew his coat over him. “You fellows can make
a night of it if you want to, but I’m going to sleep,”
said he, and a few minutes later he was peacefully
unconscious.</p>

<p>When he awoke the niggardly light of a leaden-hued
Russian morning was creeping through the
single window. For a time he walked restlessly up
and down the room. Then he paused before the
double-glazed window, which was curtained at the
bottom, and looked out.</p>

<p>“You see the pavement is of cobblestones, so to
jump would be dangerous,” commented the quiet
voice of Nicolai.</p>

<p>Drexel glanced back. “Huh!” he grunted. But
all the same he was startled at the keenness with
which Nicolai had read his mind.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Nicolai went on, “the windows are
screwed down. And even if you burst them and
got safely to the ground you would only be arrested
by the police.”</p>

<p>Drexel shrugged his shoulders and continued
gazing out into the court. It was a dreary enough
area, with a few snow-capped houses huddling
frozenly about it, its monotony relieved only by a
little stuccoed church adjoining, with five dingy
blue domes spangled with stars of weather-worn
gilt—five tarnished counterfeits of heaven. Ivan,
who had come to his side, volunteered that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
called The Church of the Three Saints, and that
this court, by virtue of its adjacency, was known as
Three Saints’ Court.</p>

<p>Drexel resumed his pacing of the room. “This
is a pretty stupid party you have invited me to,”
he yawned at length—whereupon Ivan got out an
old deck of cards, remarking that they never had
time to play these days, and proceeded to teach him
sixty-six, Nicolai keeping a steady eye on them all
the while. The game was too simple to be of much
interest, but what with it, and eating, and more
chatter from Ivan, the short dim day faded into sullen
dusk, then deepened into the long northern night.</p>

<p>Around eight o’clock footsteps were heard in the
adjoining room. Presently there was a knock and
on Ivan opening the door there entered two men,
one about thirty and the other possibly forty, in caps,
high boots and belted blouses beneath their coats.
Despite their workingmen’s dress, Drexel could tell
by the deference given them by his guards (though
they all called one another “comrade”) that they
were not what their clothes pronounced them. The
older might be a doctor, or a lawyer, or a professor.
They informed Ivan and Nicolai that there would
be a little meeting in the next room, and that they
might have a couple of hours off duty. The two
lads went out, and after them the two men, and
locked the door behind them.</p>

<p>By this time Drexel had guessed that this place,
which hid from the police behind the mask of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
workingmen’s boarding-house, was in reality a
conspirative headquarters of the revolutionists. His
first thought, on being left alone, was of escape.
But after a little thinking he realised that what
Nicolai had said of the window was quite true, that
his only avenue of escape was through the next
room, and that he was quite as securely guarded as
if the men were in this room beside him.</p>

<p>He was wondering what all this strange business
was about, grimly smiling at the situation in which
he found himself, when the sound of low voices in
the next room set him on a new train of thought.
Perhaps in that talk he might learn something
that would explain the mystery, and would aid his
escape.</p>

<p>The nicest etiquette could hardly require that a
prisoner of war should not eavesdrop upon his
captors. He put out his oil lamp for a moment.
From over the top of the door a thin knife’s edge of
light cut into his darkness. He lit his lamp, drew
a chair noiselessly to the door, and got upon it. Yes,
fortunately for him, the house was old, the door
sagged, and he had a very sufficient crack. At the
table, on which stood a single candle, the room’s
only light, sat the two men, and, her back to him,
a woman of whom he could see nothing but that she
wore the shapeless, quilted jacket, and the brown,
coarse-knit shawl wound tightly about her head,
which he had grown accustomed to seeing on
workingwomen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“What time was the American coming?” the
woman whispered.</p>

<p>“At about nine, Sonya,” one of the men replied.</p>

<p>Their voices as they went on were low—so low
that Drexel caught only fragments of sentences amid
blanks of hushed unintelligibility. But from these
fragments he pieced together two series of facts.
First, that the revolutionists he had met, and
hundreds of others, guided by the brain of the great
invisible White One, were trying to learn in what
prison Borodin was confined, as the first step in an
endeavour to bring about his escape. His capture
was a paralyzing blow to freedom’s cause, for he was
the revolutionists’ greatest statesman; his brain was
needed now, and, once the Autocracy was overthrown,
there was none who could rebuild as he. Thus
far the Government knew him only as Borodin,
and the charge on which he was arrested, writing
revolutionary articles, would mean no worse than a
few years in prison or exile to Siberia; but at any
moment the Government might discover that he
was also Borski, the sought-after leader of the uprising
in Southern Russia, and this discovery would
be followed by instant execution. So immediate
rescue was imperatively necessary.</p>

<p>Second, the young woman of his last night’s
adventure had made the bold attempt in Prince
Berloff’s house because it was believed the prince
had in his possession some document revealing
Borodin’s whereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Presently there was a knock at the outer door.
“That must be the American,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>Drexel could hardly restrain an exclamation of
surprise as the door opened and his eyes lighted upon
the newcomer. For this third man in workingman’s
clothes he knew. He was an American correspondent,
James Freeman, whom Drexel had met several
times in St. Petersburg cafés. He was a rather tall,
black-bearded man of thirty-five, with a lean suppleness
of body, piercing black eyes and a daring face.
Drexel had always felt an uncanny shrinking when
in company with Freeman, so cold, sinister and
cynical did he seem; here was a man, his instinct
told him, who respected nothing, who feared neither
God, nor man, nor devil.</p>

<p>Freeman apparently knew the two men well,
and after being introduced to the woman, he sat
down. “We received your word that you had something
to propose,” began the older of the men. “We
are ready to hear what it is.”</p>

<p>“You know me, Dr. Razoff, and you can guess its
nature.” Drexel could see the correspondent’s
black eyes glitter.</p>

<p>“If it is one of your terroristic plans, you could
have saved us all the trouble of this meeting,”
returned Razoff. “You know we do not approve
of such action.”</p>

<p>“And that’s one reason you have not succeeded
better! The only way you can move these despots is
by fear. Fear of immediate and awful annihilation!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Blow enough of them up, and you can’t get a man
bold enough to hold office. Then the Government
is yours!”</p>

<p>“You have been directing terroristic plots for
two years; you are the most implacable terrorist——”</p>

<p>“And the most successful,” put in Freeman.</p>

<p>“And the most successful that Russia has known.
And what have you gained?”</p>

<p>“Ah, but what am I, and the few that gather
around me, and the few executions that we carry
out, among a myriad of despots? Let there be a
thousand terroristic groups, and then you shall see!”</p>

<p>Razoff shook his head. “But since we are here,
we might as well hear what you have to propose.”</p>

<p>“They have Borodin, and most likely we cannot
free him. Well—make them afraid to arrest
another leader. An eye for an eye—a leader for a
leader. They have removed one of our men; as a
lesson, let us remove one of theirs.”</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“The highest possible. The Czar himself, if
the coward had not imprisoned himself in his palace
and surrounded himself with an army. Since not
the Czar, then his highest representative in St.
Petersburg. Let’s kill the military governor.”</p>

<p>“Kill Prince Valenko!” the three ejaculated
together.</p>

<p>“Aye, Prince Valenko, the very arch-foe of
freedom!” cried the terrorist. “That will teach
them it is not safe to go too far!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>There was a short silence. “What do you say,
Sonya?” Razoff asked the woman.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“And you Pestel?”</p>

<p>“I am against terrorism.”</p>

<p>“And that, Mr. Freeman, would be the answer
of the entire Central Committee,” said Razoff.
“We would not assist in a terroristic plot.”</p>

<p>“But I do not want your aid. What I want is
your sanction. To have the proper intimidating
effect, the death of Prince Valenko should not be
the act of an isolated individual, but the act of a
great organization that stands ready to repeat it.”</p>

<p>“That sanction we cannot give you.”</p>

<p>“But if I could make the proposal direct to The
White One, I’m sure he would see the matter
differently. Can you not let me see him?”</p>

<p>“As I have told you on other occasions, we are
not allowed to do so.”</p>

<p>An angry look flamed into the terrorist’s lean
dark face. “Then you don’t trust me!” he burst
out. “We may differ in methods, but have I not
proved my devotion to our cause?”</p>

<p>“Do not take this refusal as a personal matter,
Mr. Freeman. The circumstances are such that
we are not allowed to reveal The White One’s
identity to anyone. We are under oath.”</p>

<p>The terrorist was too keen a man not to see that
some slight doubt of him was lurking in their minds.
However, he silently swallowed his mortification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and took his double rebuff with a philosophic shrug.
He said he would abandon for the present his plan
against the military governor’s life, begged to be
considered a willing coöperator in whatever activity
they might devise, and then took his leave. To
Drexel, outside one door, it was a distinct relief
when that sinister figure was outside the other.</p>

<p>“To think of his proposing to <i>us</i> to kill Prince
Valenko!” said Razoff, laughing grimly.</p>

<p>“But he may undertake the plan himself,” said
the woman anxiously.</p>

<p>“If he does,” returned Razoff, “we will warn the
governor ourselves.”</p>

<p>All this while the woman had been seated, her
back to Drexel; but now she rose and went around
the table to snuff the spluttering candle. At the
graceful ease of her walk, which even her shapeless
garments could not obliterate, a wild and sudden
possibility leaped up in Drexel; and when the candlelight
fell upon her face, though forehead and chin
and cheeks were hidden by the shawl, the possibility
became a breath-taking certainty. Nose, mouth,
eyes, were the same!</p>

<p>She snuffed the candle. “Excuse me for a few
minutes,” she said to the men, and crossed straight
toward Drexel’s door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE KING AND THE BEGGAR MAID</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DREXEL slipped down and was standing at
the table when the bolt shot back and she
entered. She closed the door, and stood
looking a moment at him, and he gazed back at her.
Despite those beauty-murdering clothes, the spell
of her personality was more sovereign even than
yesternight.</p>

<p>She was the first to speak. “I have come,”
said she in that low rich voice that set his every nerve
to vibrating, “to thank you and apologize.”</p>

<p>He could only incline his head.</p>

<p>“To thank you for what you so gallantly did for
me last night.”</p>

<p>Drexel found his voice, and he could not keep a
little irony out of his words. “Your thanks seem
rather oddly expressed.” He motioned about the
imprisoning room.</p>

<p>“It is for that I would apologize. I am sorry.
But it seemed to us necessary.”</p>

<p>“Necessary! Why?”</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the face. “Because I
did not wholly trust you.”</p>

<p>“Not trust me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“You had seen me—you guessed what I had
done—you could have identified me had you seen
me again, and could have turned me over to the
police. That would possibly have meant my death;
certainly the destruction of all my plans.”</p>

<p>“Then you really tried to shoot Prince Berloff?”</p>

<p>“I did not. He fired the shots; so that he could
say I fired and bring against me the charge of
attempted assassination.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Drexel, reverting to her preceding
statement, “you seemed to trust me at first.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And then you did not?”</p>

<p>“Frankly—no.”</p>

<p>“You feared me as much as you did the police.
Why?”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“I am completely at a loss,” said he. “Come—why
did you not trust me?”</p>

<p>“That,” said she steadily, “I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>He rubbed his forehead. “Well, of all situations
a sane man ever got into!” he muttered. When he
next spoke there was again a touch of irony in his
voice. “At least,” he drawled, “would it be considered
an intrusion into matters which are none
of my concern, if I asked what is going to happen to
me?”</p>

<p>“You will merely be detained till we feel it is
safe to release you. Ivan and Nicolai are treating
you all right? We had to act instantly, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the only persons we could upon the instant command.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re nice enough boys, I guess,” said
Drexel. “But I wish they lived at a better hotel.
The janitor here doesn’t know it is winter yet, and
keeps the steam heat turned off; my bed, that sofa
there, is upholstered with soft coal and soup-bones;
and the chef—well, the chef’s repertoire is limited
to tea and bologna. But I guess I can stand it.”</p>

<p>She smiled slightly, but the smile was instantly
gone. “Your inconvenience is being suffered to
render more secure a great cause.”</p>

<p>“And to render more secure your life?”</p>

<p>“And my life,” she added.</p>

<p>She held out her hand. “Again I apologize,
and again I thank you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You are not going!” cried Drexel—but he did
not miss the opportunity of taking her hand. “Not
yet—please! There is something I want to ask
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>He looked straight into her eyes. “It is this:
Who are you?”</p>

<p>She drew her hand away. “You do not need to
know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said he. “But I wish to.”</p>

<p>“Well—I am one of a thousand girls”—there
came a flush into her face and a ring into her voice—“ten
thousand girls, yes, a hundred thousand!
who are doing the same work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Yes, I know now that you are a revolutionist.
But who are you personally?”</p>

<p>“Any one of the hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“But you are not just any one,” he persisted.
“That’s plain. You are educated, refined, have
had advantages far above the ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Do you not know,”—and her voice swelled
with a more vibrant ring—“that our universities
are filled with poor, obscure young women—poor,
yet great souls just the same! who starve themselves,
literally starve themselves, that they may gain an
education, that they may become broad, cultured
women? And do this that they may bring light and
help and hope to their down-trodden people?”</p>

<p>But Drexel was seeing her as she appeared upon
the train. “That may be so; but you are not of
that kind,” he said confidently. “That kind does
not look as you did last night.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know,” she cried, stretching
wide her arms the better to display her clumsy
garments, “that last night’s clothes are any truer
index of my station than to-night’s?”</p>

<p>She saw the question struck home. “We revolutionists
work in hourly danger from the police.
Safety compels us to assume disguises, and we fit
our disguises to our missions. My mission of
yesterday required that I should seem what you call
a lady.”</p>

<p>“You mean that your yesterday’s clothes were
only a disguise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Only a disguise.”</p>

<p>He pondered for a moment. No, a woman of
position, which he had half guessed her to be, would
have no reason for discontent; no reason for risking
comfort, wealth, life even, in this struggle for better
conditions. After all, she was probably one of those
rarely beautiful, rare-spirited women who now and
again flower among the common people.</p>

<p>“Then this is all I am to know?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“That I am just one of the hundred thousand—that
is all.”</p>

<p>She started toward the door.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he cried. “Wait! Surely I shall see
you again.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “You are not to be released
till after my mission has been accomplished. By
that time I shall have disappeared. This is the
last time we shall meet. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Her hand was on the knob, when Drexel sprang
forward and threw himself between her and the
door.</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” his words burst forth. “I
can’t lose you forever like this! I can’t! I can’t!”</p>

<p>She drew back and gazed at him with a flashing,
imperious manner. “What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“It means I love you!” he cried. “It means I
do not care who you are—what you are. I love
you. I love you! With all my heart—with all my
soul!”</p>

<p>At the sight of his big, strong, quivering body, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
tense, working face, the hauteur all slipped out of her
bearing.</p>

<p>“You are in earnest?” she asked slowly, in amazement.</p>

<p>“God strike me dead if I am not! And as never
before in all my life!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry—sorry,” she said with true sympathy.
“Even if I cared—it could not be. The
liberty of my country has first place in my heart.
That is my husband.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse me?” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“I must.”</p>

<p>“And this is final?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” he cried, inflamed with love
and the danger of the loved one’s eternal loss, and
seizing at every argument. “Listen!” He stepped
nearer her. “Listen, before you speak finally.
I can take you out of this poverty, this turmoil,
this oppression! I can give you peace, and comfort,
and position!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she breathed. “Again the king stoops
to the beggar maid.”</p>

<p>Swept madly on by his desire to win her, his dreams
for a towering financial future rushed into the form
of argument. He stood before her the impassioned
embodiment of the American hero—the strong,
masterful man of affairs, flashing forth an all-conquering
confidence.</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried he, and he glowed dominantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
down upon her. “You shall have everything!
Everything! You and I, side by side, shall go
breast to breast with the foremost. I tell you, with
your beauty, you shall queen it over every woman
in Chicago!”</p>

<p>He had not noted the strange, quiet look that had
come into her face. “In substance, you mean to tell
me that you can give me position.”</p>

<p>“I can give you the very highest!”</p>

<p>“You are of an old family, then?”</p>

<p>“None older in Chicago!”</p>

<p>She did not speak.</p>

<p>“Come!” he went on with the mighty rush of his
schemes. “Mine is to be no trifling million-dollar
success. I do not mean to boast—but I feel the
power in me! No young man in America has a
chance like mine! I shall become one of the first
business men of America! It is sure—sure as that
the years roll round. I shall become the master of
railroads, of mines, of factories. All—all!—are
going to yield me their wealth. And that means
power, and more power—and position, and greater
position. And this wealth, this power, this position,
shall all be yours!”</p>

<p>As he spoke she had slowly unwound the shawl
that tightly bound her head; and the beauty of her
face, with its crown of rich dark hair, was before
him unobscured, unconfined. She had drawn herself
up, her breath was coming and going with slow
tensity, and her eyes—those wonderful blue eyes—were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
blazing full upon him. But she did not
speak.</p>

<p>“Well,” demanded Drexel, “what do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say,” said she, and her words came with slow,
sharp distinctness, “that you are the most despicable
man I ever met!”</p>

<p>“What!” he cried. And he stepped back against
the door, as though she had struck him in the face.</p>

<p>The eyes still blazed with awful contempt into
his own, and the slow words went on:</p>

<p>“You are a man of great gifts. I see that.
Genius, maybe—perhaps great genius. And
doubtless you will achieve all you say. But for a
man with divine gifts, to devote those divine gifts
to gigantic schemes for selfish gain, which means
to the despoilment, to the misery, to the crushing
down, of his fellows—I repeat, such a man is the
most despicable man I ever met!”</p>

<p>The paleness of Drexel’s face began to redden with
anger.</p>

<p>“I see,” said he grimly, “that you are one of these
socialists!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said she, steadily.</p>

<p>“Yes”—between his angry, clenched teeth.
“There are some of your kind even in my country.
Disappointed, snivelling failures, snarling at people
who have succeeded!” His anger blazed fiercer.
“Let me tell you this, young lady. You would not
be so contemptuous of people with position, if
you had a little of position yourself! Nor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
wealth, if you had ever tasted a little of wealth’s
comforts!”</p>

<p>But she did not quail before his fire. “Perhaps
not,” she returned, quietly.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence between the two.</p>

<p>“And now, will you please allow me to pass?”
she said.</p>

<p>Her words sent all the anger out of him.</p>

<p>“But,” he besought desperately, “surely sometime
I may meet you again?”</p>

<p>“This is the last time,” said she with quiet finality.</p>

<p>“Forever?”</p>

<p>“Forever.”</p>

<p>He leaned against the door and stared at her with
dizzy pain; till she recalled him by repeating,</p>

<p>“Will you please allow me to pass?”</p>

<p>He dumbly stood aside and opened the door.
She hesitated, then gave him her hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you once more. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said he.</p>

<p>She passed out. And the door closed and the
bolt clicked into place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>CONCERNING THE MYSTERY OF A PRINCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a dull room, Drexel’s prison, and
Drexel’s presence did not brighten it. To
have met and loved and lost a girl all
within the space of twenty-four hours, was hardly
an experience to make a man enlivening company.
Most of the time he lay upon the old sofa, gruffly
refusing when Ivan drew out the cards with the
purpose of easing his tedium, paying no heed to the
young fellow’s chatter, and no heed to the pair’s
going and coming. His every nerve throbbed with
the anguish of her loss, an anguish that he felt would
never leave him.</p>

<p>And added to that anguish was the bitterness
of humiliation. Brought up as one among the most
exclusive and powerful, he could not escape a pride
in his position; nor could he escape the knowledge
that in Chicago those wise mothers who could
calculate what a man would grow to be in a decade or
two considered him the catch of the city. Yet he
had been refused by an unknown girl, a girl whose
rich clothes, possibly the only good ones she had
ever worn, had been admittedly supplied her as
a disguise. And more, this girl he loved with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
his being had scorned him in scathing words—him
and his giant projects.</p>

<p>Certainly enough to gloom any man. But Drexel
had yet a further reason for despair. Many a man,
refused, even scorned as he had been, had stuck
grimly to his suit and in the end won her he loved.
But, in faith, how was a lover stubbornly to persevere
when there was no loved one against whom to aim
his perseverance? Ah, that was the worst of it all—he
was never to see her again.</p>

<p>Four more days he lived in this gloomy aloofness,
and during this time Ivan and Nicolai settled into
a routine management of their task; one would
sleep and the other guard, and on two occasions
one or the other had left the house for his period off
duty. During these days, though there was no
abatement of the anguish, Drexel thought often of
the utter uselessness of his being held a prisoner.
What intention had he of giving the slightest aid
toward the capture of Sonya? Would she not be
just as safe if he were free?</p>

<p>Plans for escape haunted his mind. But escape
was not so easy. True, the one hundred and
thirty pounds of either of his captors would have
been nothing to his one hundred ninety, but Ivan
or Nicolai, whichever it was, always had the black
pistol in readiness, and always had his quick eyes
upon him. Before he could leap upon his guard, or
before he could burst the window and spring out
or shout for the police, there would be a deadly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
bullet in him. Besides, leaping from the window,
even should he escape the bullet, would probably
mean serious injury upon the cobblestones below;
and shouting for help would mean his capture,
and the capture of Ivan and Nicolai. He did not
wish to involve them in trouble, for he liked the
queer pair. And, moreover, this move might
endanger the safety of Sonya. No, if he escaped,
his escape must bring no risk upon these hostile
friends; it had to be an escape from the police as
well as from revolutionists.</p>

<p>In the end his escape proved to be a comparatively
simple matter. In the afternoon of the fifth day of
his captivity Nicolai turned over the watch to Ivan
and sallied forth. It had been part of Drexel’s
craft to lie upon his couch, appearing to nap much
of the time, thinking that thus he could best watch
his jailers and throw them off their guard. He
was now stretched upon the sofa, his semblance that
of a sleeping man. Ivan looked at him, looked at
the table which needed clearing after their late
lunch, a chore which he could easily do if the prisoner
slept—then tip-toed to Drexel’s side, gazed at him
with his sharp eyes, then bent low to make certain.</p>

<p>Suddenly Drexel’s arms shot up. His left hand,
with a powerful wrench, tore the pistol from Ivan’s
grasp, the right closed upon the little fellow’s throat.
Drexel had some knowledge of anatomy, and with
all his force he pressed his thumb up under the jaw
against the pneumogastric nerve. Ivan struggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
convulsively beneath this paralyzing pressure—weakened—then
quieted into limp unconsciousness.
Instantly Drexel thrust his handkerchief into Ivan’s
mouth, tied this gag securely, and by the time Ivan’s
eyes fluttered open had him bound hand and foot
with the ropes prepared for his own confinement.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, comrade,” said he, gazing down at
his late captor. “But I did not want to impose upon
your hospitality any longer, and I did not see any
other way to leave. I really am sorry if I hurt you—for
I like you, Ivan.”</p>

<p>As he slipped into his big coat, Ivan tugged
impotently at his bonds. “Well—good-bye, my
lad,” said Drexel. “And tell your people they have
nothing in the world to fear from me. I’m as safe
outside as I would be in here with your guns against
my chest.”</p>

<p>He picked up his Browning and was putting it
in his pocket when he caught a look of longing in
Ivan’s eyes. He laid the pistol on the table.</p>

<p>“Keep it as a little souvenir,” he said, and with a
friendly wave of the hand he unlocked the door
and went out.</p>

<p>But misfortune was not yet done with him. As he
started to creep down the stairway a step creaked and
the boarding-house keeper came into the hall. “The
devil!” he ejaculated and barred the foot of the
stairs with his powerful body.</p>

<p>“Ivan! Nicolai!” he shouted.</p>

<p>For an instant Drexel regretted the pistol he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
given Ivan, but there was no time to return for it.
He plunged down at his big antagonist; the man
set his body and opened his arms to grapple with
the escaping prisoner. But Drexel was not minded
to get into that detaining clutch. He sent his fist
into the other’s chest; the boarding-house keeper,
true Russian that he was, knew nothing of the art
of boxing, and in the instant that he gasped and
floundered Drexel drove a blow into his unguarded
solar plexis. He went down in a heap, and Drexel
sprang by him and out into the court.</p>

<p>Ahead of him lay danger from arrest by the police.
But he knew that if once he could get back to the
Hotel Europe he would be safe, for no police official
would dream of identifying the hunted American with
the cousin-to-be of Prince Berloff. Though but little
after three, night had already fallen. The darkness
was an aid, and with the shawl collar of his shuba
turned up so that only nose and eyes were visible,
he slipped across and out of the court, and hailed
the first swift-looking sleigh he met. He offered the
driver double fare, the driver laid on his whip, and
half an hour later he walked nonchalantly into
the official-filled Hotel Europe.</p>

<p>He found his uncle had arrived from America only
that morning. The old man was overjoyed to see him,
and Drexel would have felt a pleasure no less than
his uncle’s had it not been for the pain of his love.</p>

<p>John Howard was a sturdy, upstanding old man
of close upon seventy, with a shaggy-browed, clean-shaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> 
face, and shrewd gray eyes that could twinkle
humorously or glint like steel; a man feared and
admired by his friends, feared and hated by his
enemies. He had made his great fortune as America’s
great fortunes have been made, by his superior
might, by thinking solely of his own gain, and
thinking little or none about such matters as law,
or ethics, or the other fellow, or the public; and he
believed his methods just and proper. There was
no surface suavity about him, no hypocritical
pretense; he was bluff and outspoken—he was
just what he was.</p>

<p>Uncle and nephew went down to the cafe together,
as Mrs. Howard and Alice were out making calls.
Mr. Howard was full of the great traction deal—the
deal that was to be his climatic exit, and
Drexel’s triumphant entrance, as a great financial
figure—and he rapidly sketched a summary of
the developments of the three months that Drexel
had been in Russia. They had practically got
control of all the street-railway franchises of Chicago
for a long term; and had acted so quietly that the
city had not a guess of what was going on. They
expected to break up the system into separate lines
and discontinue the transfers, and thus get millions
of extra nickels a year from the people; and to reorganize,
and in that process to net some fifteen
million dollars from unsophisticated investors by
the everyday miracle of turning water into stock;
and to perform some of the other feats of financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
legerdemain by which kings of business win and
maintain their sovereignty. All of which astute and
mighty brigandage seemed as proper and legitimate
to Drexel as it did to his uncle. One was a founder
of a business school, the other an apt pupil; and the
fundamental idea of that school was that one’s
business concerned no one but one’s self.</p>

<p>“Now tell me about things here,” said Mr.
Howard. “I’ve talked with your aunt, but I want
to hear from you. You’ve quite got over that—eh—little
feeling for Alice?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“I knew you would.” He nodded his head.
“And Alice? You remember when the news of
the engagement came to us in Chicago, you spoke
of an affair—not like yours, but a real one—between
her and Jack Hammond. Has she been
acting much like the romantic damsel with a broken
heart?”</p>

<p>Visions of his pretty cousin rose before Drexel’s
mind—at balls splendid with brilliant uniforms
and glittering gowns—at grand dinners where
sat none but those of proud and noble lineage;
and at all he saw Alice dazzled, happy, exulting with
girlish pride that her place was soon to be among
the highest of these.</p>

<p>“Much of a heartbreak?” persisted the old man.</p>

<p>“I must admit,” Drexel acknowledged slowly,
“that Jack Hammond doesn’t seem to trouble her
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Just as I told you it would be!”</p>

<p>They were silent a moment, during which Drexel
bowed to a woman sitting at a near-by table; and
he gave an inward start as he saw the tall, well-dressed
man with a swart Mephistophelian handsomeness,
who sat at table with her. It was Freeman,
the terrorist.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard’s sharp eyes had followed his
nephew’s glance. “Say, but she’s a stunner!” he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>And she was—a superb compromise between
blond and brunette, in the first fulness of womanhood,
with the ease and grace and rather confident
smile of the acknowledged beauty, and gowned in a
green robe that had all the richness and distinction
that the Parisian modistes of French St. Petersburg
could give it.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” Mr. Howard asked.</p>

<p>“Countess Baronova. She’s a widow. Her husband
was killed in the Japanese war.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howard looked the young man straight in
the face. “Bevare o’ vidders, my boy,” he said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Needn’t worry—nothing doing there,” Drexel
returned; but he did not see fit to add that it was not
from lack of encouragement from the widow.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a stunner!” his uncle repeated. “And
now, tell me, Henry—what do you think of our
prince?”</p>

<p>“You have not seen him yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“No. He had an audience with the Czar to-day,
Alice told me. How do you size him up?”</p>

<p>Drexel’s eyes fell to the cloth and he hesitated.
“As a prince? Or as a man?”</p>

<p>“Both. First as a prince. O. K., isn’t he?
You remember that as soon as your aunt cabled me
from Paris about the engagement, I cabled the proper
parties to investigate him. They said he was the
real thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s the real thing all right. He belongs
to the highest nobility—hasn’t played the deuce
with his fortune—is a man of great political power.”</p>

<p>“Good! Agrees exactly with the reports sent
me. Just what sort of an official is he?”</p>

<p>“There you have me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know! And been knocking around with
him for three months!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have asked him, once or twice. But he
answered he did not exactly know himself. He
said he guessed he was a sort of consulting attorney
to the Government. He is frequently closeted with
this general and that governor, with the minister
of this and the minister of that, and is summoned
every now and then to see the Czar. That’s all I
know, and the few people I’ve discreetly quizzed
about him seem to know no more.”</p>

<p>“A sort of mystery, eh?”</p>

<p>“In a way—yes; though he makes light of there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
being anything mysterious in his position. He says
he really has no official status at all, that he is no
more than a private gentleman. In fact, if he were
an official he’d have to be in St. Petersburg more
than he is; most of his time he spends on an estate
about fifty miles away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Alice spoke of that estate; she said we
were going out there to a house party day after
to-morrow. The prince part of him sounds all
right. How about the man?”</p>

<p>“He will doubtless call when he returns from the
Czar. That will answer your question.”</p>

<p>The shrewd old eyes looked deep. “I see you
don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“Put it the other way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t like you—eh? Why?”</p>

<p>“I can only give you a guess.”</p>

<p>“Your guess is as good as most men’s certainties.
Go on.”</p>

<p>“Well—the fact is, he found out about—about
Alice and me, you know.”</p>

<p>The uncle nodded. “And he’s a little suspicious—jealous.
That’s one reason. What else?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know of course what he is marrying
Alice for. Money. Not that he’s hard up. But
he’s ambitious—terrifically ambitious. He dreams
of becoming the greatest man in the empire, next
to the Czar. He——”</p>

<p>“It sounds to me like we’d picked out a good one!”
broke in his uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“He knows that in this poverty-stricken country
nothing will help him forward like money—for
he already has birth and brains. Well, he has
learned from aunt about the arrangement you have
been so good as to make for me—about your going
to give me a part of your fortune, and your going
to leave its management, even when it’s Alice’s,
in my hands. He wants entire control of it all as
soon as he can get it; the use of the lump sum will
forward his plans much better than the use of the
income alone. So he looks upon me as an obstacle
between him and his ambition. That’s the other
reason for his not loving me.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, then—why don’t you like him? Not
just because he’s marrying Alice?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stop liking Jack Hammond if Alice
were to marry Jack.”</p>

<p>“What is the reason then?”</p>

<p>Drexel hesitated. “I can’t explain. Nothing
definite. He’s rather cold, and formal, and distant.
But that isn’t it. It’s just a sort of uneasy feeling
that I have when with him. I guess that’s really
all. In fact— But there he comes now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE PRINCESS OF HEARTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT first came Alice. Snow was upon her
light fluffy hair and her long fur coat,
and her cheeks were pink with the cold
and her eyes bright with the excitement of this first
meeting between father and fiancé. Next came
her mother, her matronly figure amplified by her
thick Russian coat, exultant satisfaction on her
proud face—the sense of having triumphantly
done the thing she had started out to do. And
behind them came the prince, whom the two had
met at the entrance of the hotel.</p>

<p>The great financier took the slender hand of his
ancient-blooded son-in-law. He looked him keenly
over, all the while the words of getting acquainted
were being exchanged—looked him over with
growing satisfaction. The prince was a man,
despite his forty years, who well might capture a
young girl’s fancy. He was straight, with the easy
grace of a courtier, and wore a dark green uniform of
a colonel of the Czar’s Guards, with a heavy festoon
of gold braid across his breast and with high patent-leather
boots. He was the acme of ancient lineage
and high breeding; his face was pale, his lips and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
nostrils were thin, his black moustache had just the
proper upward lift, his slight baldness only made
more suggestive of power a forehead naturally large,
and the great scar on his left cheek (a Heidelberg
scar) that might have disfigured a coarser man only
added to his distinguished air. Diplomat, soldier,
art connoisseur, student, it was said of him that the
Czar’s domain held no more polished gentleman.
No wonder Alice admired and her father was satisfied;
this was no mere hang-lipped, chinless, stuttering,
penniless title.</p>

<p>After the formal words natural to the situation
had all been said, the talk ran to other matters—first
to the house party the prince was giving in the
Howards’ honour, and then to a ball which they
all expected to attend that night at the palace of
Prince Valenko, the military governor.</p>

<p>Alice turned to Drexel. “You are fortunate,
Henry, to get back in time to meet Princess Valenko.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall not go,” he returned. Only one
woman interested him, and she was of a sort far
different from this great lady.</p>

<p>“Not go!” cried his aunt. “You must not miss
meeting the princess!”</p>

<p>“No,” added Alice, darting a quick look at the
prince, “you must not fail to meet Princess Valenko.”</p>

<p>“And what is so wonderful about this Princess
Valenko?” put in Mr. Howard.</p>

<p>“She’s the handsomest young woman in St.
Petersburg—so they say,” returned Alice, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a sceptical toss of her head. “We’ve heard nothing
but Princess Valenko ever since we entered Russia.”</p>

<p>Again she darted a look at Berloff. The prince
knew well the meaning of this glance; it was an
open secret that he had been a suitor for the princess,
and she had refused him. But he met Alice’s
challenging look with an impassive smile.</p>

<p>“Also she is my cousin,” said he to Mr. Howard.
But, he did not add, cousin on his mother’s side,
and so of far older stock than he.</p>

<p>“Her father is the military governor of St. Petersburg,”
added Mrs. Howard. “They say she is
the proudest, haughtiest young—I beg your pardon,
prince, but that’s just what people say.” She looked
at her husband. “We haven’t met her yet. She
has been travelling in France, Italy and Germany,
and she returned only to-day.”</p>

<p>“I saw her,” Alice announced.</p>

<p>“You were at her house?” asked the prince.</p>

<p>“No. I was out driving this morning and I
chanced to go near the Warsaw Station just after
the Berlin Express had arrived. She had just
come in from Berlin. I saw her drive by.”</p>

<p>“Was she as beautiful as people say?” Drexel
asked mechanically.</p>

<p>Alice sniffed. “Oh, I suppose some men might
think her moderately good-looking. Judge for
yourself when you see her to-night.”</p>

<p>“You will have an even better chance to judge
her day after to-morrow,” said the prince. “She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
has just written that she is coming to the house
party.”</p>

<p>At this moment Countess Baronova, sweeping
past, bowed to them. “And you are coming, too,
countess?” added the prince.</p>

<p>She paused. “Coming to what?”</p>

<p>“To my house party.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Your parties, prince, are the sort
one cannot afford to miss.”</p>

<p>They asked her to join the group, and as Freeman
at this moment came up with her coat upon his
arm, they could but include him in the invitation.
Drexel felt a shiver as the lean, dark correspondent
sat down among them; and he could but wonder
what these women would think, what the prince
would think, if they knew what he knew. Drexel
watched him covertly. The lean, lithe grace of
his figure, the reposeful alertness of his gleaming
eyes, the cool indifference with which he met the
prince’s thinly hid disdain—all these bore it in
upon him again that here was a man who respected
no one, who feared no one.</p>

<p>It was not long ere these qualities had exemplification.
The three women presently withdrew, and
Mr. Howard began to question the prince about
Russia’s political situation. The prince answered
that the Czar was kindly, that he loved his people
and did only what was best for them; but like a
father with an unruly son he had to chastise where
he loved. As for the trouble, that was all made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
by the country’s scum—and it would be best for
the country if it were exterminated.</p>

<p>Freeman’s eyes had begun to blaze. “Your
last statement, prince, is quite true,” he said quietly.
“Yet it is altogether misleading.”</p>

<p>“Misleading?” the prince queried coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes. You neglected to inform Mr. Howard
that the trouble-making scum whose extermination
would so benefit the country, is where the scum
always is—at the top.”</p>

<p>“You mean?” said the prince.</p>

<p>“I mean the officials, the nobility—and royalty,
if you please.”</p>

<p>The prince gave a start and slowly wet his thin
lips. Drexel held his breath, and waited what
should come next. He knew what temper of a
man was the terrorist; and he knew, too, that a man
who had merely refused to rise when the Czar had
been toasted in a restaurant had been shot dead
in his chair by an officer opposite—and the officer
had been acquitted.</p>

<p>“Do you not think,” said the prince, with
a steel-like edge to his voice, “that you are
speaking a little rashly, considering you are in
Russia?”</p>

<p>The terrorist was leaning insouciantly back in
his chair, but his eyes were flaming. “An American,
sir,” said he, “is not afraid to speak the truth, no
matter in what tyrant’s land he finds himself.”</p>

<p>The prince’s face darkened. He again wet his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
lips, his long interlocked hands tightened and his
eyes gleamed back into the terrorist’s.</p>

<p>“My advice to you, sir,” and there was an ominous
threat in his voice, “and to all other foreign scribblers,
is to keep a quieter tongue in your head!”</p>

<p>“You think you can cow me?” said Freeman,
a contemptuous, defiant sneer upon his lips. “You
can kill me—yes. But let me tell you, all you
blood-sucking officials, all you nation-crushing
aristocrats, you, and your snivelling, cowardly,
blood-drenched little Czar——”</p>

<p>Berloff sprang to his feet. “What, you insult
the Czar!” and like the dart of a serpent his hand
flashed across the table and struck Freeman full
in the mouth.</p>

<p>Freeman shot up like a released spring, his dark
face livid, and made to hurl himself upon the prince.
Drexel seized an arm. Its tense muscles were
like steel wire, and it flung him aside with one
violent sweep, and again the terrorist made for the
prince. For an instant Drexel feared for Berloff’s
life; but officers from an adjoining table threw
themselves upon the terrorist, and a moment later
he was securely held by gendarmes. He struggled
and hurled fierce defiance at the prince, who stood
erect and impassive, with just the faintest tinge in
his white cheeks.</p>

<p>“You’ll remember this!” cried the terrorist,
darkly.</p>

<p>Berloff did not answer—gazed at him with cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
contempt as he was bundled out. Perhaps he did
remember—perhaps not. But afterward Drexel
remembered—and remembered well.</p>

<p>This sudden flare-up of passion drew upon them
the curious stare of the dozens of people in the cafe,
and the terrorist had not been five minutes gone
before the other three withdrew, the prince going
to the apartment he maintained for his occasional
St. Petersburg visits, and Drexel and his uncle
mounting to their rooms above. His uncle asked
about Freeman, and Drexel told what was common
knowledge, holding back the sinister information
he had gained in Three Saints’ Court; for he had
decided to say nothing, for the present at least, of
his adventure with the young woman and the experiences
into which it had led him.</p>

<p>They had just finished dinner—at which the
prince had joined them—when a card was handed
to Drexel. He looked at it, and for a moment
hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’ll see him,” he said to the servant. “Have
him shown to my sitting-room.”</p>

<p>He excused himself and left the Howards’ apartment
for his own quarters. He paced the room
excitedly. Perhaps here was a clue through which
he might find the young woman! But he was cool
enough when the visitor entered.</p>

<p>“Will you be seated, Mr. Freeman,” said he
calmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the correspondent, taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
indicated chair. “I dare say you are surprised to
see me at liberty, after what just happened. Were
I a Russian I should not be; but Russia is careful
how she treats citizens of powerful foreign countries.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “But enough of
that. I have come on what I hope will prove an
acceptable matter of business to you; on what is
to me a matter of humanity, and— But we’ll pass
my motives. May I trouble you for two minutes?”</p>

<p>“You may,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>Freeman drew his chair nearer. “I must begin
by taking you into my confidence, a confidence I
know you will respect. My real purpose in Russia
is actively to help the revolutionists in their struggle.
Perhaps you wonder at my confiding in a person
who is to be the cousin of Prince Berloff. But I
believe I am shrewd enough to have seen that no
love is lost between Prince Berloff and yourself.
Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Well, then—let me tell you that I am in close
touch with the revolutionists. The revolution is
bound to succeed. But what it needs just now
is money—money for arms. To gain liberty for
their country the revolutionists can afford to pay
a hundred per cent.—yes, a thousand per cent.
Now to come straight to the point: would you consider
undertaking to secure some large sum for the
revolutionists, in return for which an authorized
committee would bind themselves to give you certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
business privileges and properties now controlled
by the present Government—land, railroads, mines,
and such? Would you consider it?”</p>

<p>A week before, had Drexel seen definite prospect
of the revolutionists’ success, he would have leaped
at this as a wonderful business opportunity. But
it was quite another influence that now determined
his reply. Freeman had been in conference with
Sonya and her friends; he was going to be in further
conference with them; to enter into this plan, even
if he chose not to carry it out, would mean that
somehow he would again come into contact with
Sonya.</p>

<p>“I would consider it,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Would you meet with a duly authorized committee
to talk it over?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He thought of the conference he had
witnessed four nights since, and he wondered if
he would come before the same group. “Meet
where?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am supposed not to give the address, and I
would rather not.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” Drexel returned stiffly. “But
either I know where I am going, or I do not
go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well;” and Freeman gave the address
of the house in Three Saints’ Court. He rose.
“This of course has been only a preliminary talk.
I shall see you again in the course of two or three
days. Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Drexel, preoccupied with this new chance of his
finding again the girl he loved, returned to the
Howards’ apartment, and found them prepared to
start to the ball at Prince Valenko’s. In his present
mood he shrank from that brilliant show. He
preferred to remain at home, kept company by
thoughts of a beautiful, spirited young woman in
the coarse, shapeless clothing of a factory girl.
He tried to beg off; but Alice would not hear of
losing a convenient cavalier whom she might have
need of—and his uncle demanded, if he did not
go, with whom was he to talk, with nobody around
him except people that spoke only French and this
fizz and pin-wheel business that they called Russian?
So Drexel could do nothing but consent and follow
to the carriage.</p>

<p>They drove past the Winter Palace, empty of
royalty, for the Czar, in fear of those he ruled, dared
not trust his person there—past huge grand-ducal
palaces—and presently they entered a great mansion
that looked forth upon the ice-bound Neva.
Drexel was well accustomed to the luxury of the
rich Russian nobility, but even he, with his double
reason for being dull to impressions, could but note
that he had been in no house so rich as this. And
he recognized that, save for the Czar and his immediate
family, there were none prouder and higher in
all the empire than these haughty men whose breasts
were a blaze of orders and these haughty women
who seemed to walk amid a moving fire of jewels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
And of them all, he well knew, none had lineage
older, nobler, than Princess Valenko.</p>

<p>Drexel did not see the princess upon his entry,
for interest in the famed beauty, long absent abroad,
was high, and she had been swept aside into one
of the drawing-rooms by an admiring group and
was there the prisoner of her guests. Drexel
ascended to the brilliant ball-room. A little later,
while he was standing with his uncle and Prince
Berloff, General Valenko, recognizing Berloff,
paused a moment beside them. The military
governor was straight, gray-haired, gray-bearded, a
splendid figure of a soldier-statesman at sixty-five,
his bearing and every feature marked with that pride
which unbends only to equals, with strength, decision,
dominance. There was also that in his face and
bearing which suggested that his character was fibred
with pitiless severity—with that despotic severity
which becomes a mere matter of course after a lifetime
of service to the most autocratic and cruel of
Christian governments.</p>

<p>“You would not think to look at him, would you,”
said Drexel after the general had passed on, taking
Berloff with him, “that he loves his daughter more
than he does his life? Yet that is what people say.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howard’s glance followed the straight, proud
figure. “He looks to me more like that old Roman
party—what do you call him, Brutus—that
ordered his own son executed. The girl must be
a wonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“They say half the best young nobility of Russia
have proposed to her—and been refused.”</p>

<p>“A sort of queen of hearts—eh?”</p>

<p>“You guessed close, uncle, to what they call her.
She is known as ‘The Princess of Hearts.’”</p>

<p>“Well,” grumbled his uncle, “I wish she’d step
lively. I’m getting anxious to see her.”</p>

<p>And so was Drexel, a little, even if his heart did
belong to a woman of quite a different station.</p>

<p>But they had not long to wait. Of a sudden
there fell a hush, and into the room through the
wide entrance at the farther end, upon the arm of
the gray, erect Prince Valenko, there swept a tall
slender young woman in a shimmering, lacy gown,
with gems twinkling from her corsage, from her
throat, from the tiara on her high-done hair. Her
chin was held high, her eyes swept the room with
cold hauteur, in her every movement was knowledge
of her ancient princely blood and of her peerless
beauty.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” breathed Mr. Howard. “The
Princess of Hearts—I should say so!”</p>

<p>The sudden clutch of Drexel’s hand made him
turn. “Hello, there—what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Drexel, suddenly cold, stood with bulging eyes
fixed upon her. For four nights before she had
worn a factory girl’s shawl and jacket, and he had
told her that he loved her!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>ONE WOMAN—OR TWO?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AND so this famous beauty, this proud daughter
of Russia’s proudest nobility, was the
unknown girl of his strange adventure,
was the working-girl who had talked so passionately
of liberty! Now, in this almost royal circle, she
was cold and haughty and disdainful, her manner
as lofty toward all beneath her as could have been
the highest of French noblewomen’s in the days
before the Revolution overwhelmed France with
its cataclysm;—and yet, how she had flamed forth
in her love of the people! How it could all be was
almost too much for Drexel’s reeling brain; but
that wonderful grace, those wonderful eyes, that
wonderful face—Russia held not their duplicate!</p>

<p>Until this moment it had not occurred to him
that there had been anything unworthy in his proposal
of marriage. But now, swift after the first
blow of astonishment, he grew hot with shame
through all his body. He had, in high-born, lofty
fashion offered to lift her out of her poverty and
give her wealth; he whose wealth was all yet to be
made, to her one of Russia’s richest heiresses. He
had spoken of his birth, and had offered her position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and family; he who barely knew the name of his
grandfather’s father, to her whose forebears were
great nobles when the Norsemen made their storied
voyage to America; whose line went back and back
even to the mighty Rurick, and then disappeared
into the mist of legend that hangs over all things
Russian before the ninth century.</p>

<p>But there were too many stirring puzzles here for
even shame to dominate him long. He had been
with her in this same St. Petersburg in her role of
working-girl but four evenings ago, yet how was
it that to-day she had arrived in state from abroad?
And why had she caused him to be held a prisoner?
And what would be the effect on her, who thought
him safe under guard, suddenly to face him?</p>

<p>But the questions that surged into his mind had
no time to complete themselves, much less to find
answers, for the princess had crossed the ball-room
and was now but a few yards distant. He was
certain she had not seen him, and he turned his
back to avoid her for a double reason; because, in
his shame he shrunk from the meeting, and because
he feared seeing him there unexpectedly might
deeply startle her and even be her betrayal. But
a hand fell upon his arm, and a voice in French—Prince
Berloff’s voice—fell upon his ears:</p>

<p>“Drexel, I want you to meet my cousin, Princess
Valenko.”</p>

<p>He would have spared her this public show of
her dismay if he could, but now it was beyond him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Hating himself that it fell to his part thus to be her
undoing, he turned and looked her in the face.</p>

<p>But there was no falling back, no consternation,
not so much as a start. She gave him a straight cold
look, in which there was not the faintest recognition
of a previous meeting.</p>

<p>So surprised was he by her self-command that he
could only mumble his way through the introduction,
and he only vaguely heard her express in composed,
formal phrases her pleasure at meeting one who
was in a manner to be a relative. Then the others
who had surrounded her were for a moment swept
away, and they two were left alone together, face
to face.</p>

<p>The few sentences they had exchanged had been
in French. “Princess, I want to apologize—yes,
a thousand times,” Drexel said hurriedly in English,
“for the caddish way I spoke to you four nights
ago.”</p>

<p>Her answer was to gaze at him with a puzzled,
blank expression.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you how ashamed I am,” Drexel
hurried on. “And I want to assure you”—this
barely above a whisper and with all his earnestness—“that
I shall never breathe a word of your secret.”</p>

<p>Still the puzzled, blank expression.</p>

<p>“Won’t you—after a time—forgive me? And
won’t you trust me?”</p>

<p>Still she wore the same non-understanding look.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dazing idea flashed into him. “Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
you do not speak English?” he asked in
French.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, in amused bewilderment.
“Yes—a vair leetle,” she said, in anything but
Sonya’s pure and fluent English. “I understand
Meestair Drexel’s words. But what he means—”
She shook her head. “I think you make some
meestake.”</p>

<p>She was carried away from him before he could
speak again, giving him a half-friendly nod from
her imperious head. After all, had he made a mistake?
After all, was it possible that she was not
Sonya? Could it be that he was the witness and
victim of one of those strange caprices of nature
which now and again casts two unrelated persons,
perhaps from the extremes of the social scale, in
the same mould? Could it be that Sonya was
merely the double of Princess Valenko? Or was
this just an unparalleled exhibition of nerve on the
princess’s part—a marvellous bit of acting?</p>

<p>Never was a man more mystified than Drexel.
All during the ball the questions ran through his
mind, and sometimes the answers were yes, and
sometimes no. Once he danced with the princess,
but that relieved his bewilderment not at all, for
she was perfectly at her ease, smilingly remarked
once or twice in her hesitating English upon his
mistake, and accorded him that faintly gracious
treatment such a high-born beauty might naturally
bestow upon a relative of a relative-to-be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Finally, toward two o’clock, Drexel decided he
could best think the matter over in solitude, and he
started home, walking for the sake of the brain-clearing
fresh air. He had gone but a hundred
yards or so when he became conscious that two
shadowy forms were moving ahead of him, and one
was lurking in the rear. The first two suddenly
vanished, but the events of the last few days had
made him alert for danger; his eyes went everywhere,
and he held himself in tense readiness, so
that when the two made a sudden rush at him
from a breach in the river-wall, he quickly side-stepped,
and sped along the river till he sighted a
wandering sleigh. Back in the security of his room,
he realized that the revolutionists were not through
with him, and that he was in danger every time
he left his four walls.</p>

<p>But he had greater matters to consider than this.
During most of the night, and all the next morning,
he was thinking over the many questions that beset
his mind. Foremost, was or was not Sonya identical
with Princess Valenko? He considered their
points of similarity—weighed this against that.
But at every turn he was balked by the fact that
Sonya had tried to seize documents from Berloff’s
house, and yet Berloff had last night treated the
princess with most deferential courtesy—by the
fact that only the day before she had arrived in
aristocratic splendour from abroad—by her cool,
smiling ignorance of him and what he talked of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>But finally, casting all bewildering pros and
cons aside, he concluded that if such a high-spirited
woman as the princess had been leading such a
dangerous double life and had found herself in such
a situation as last night’s, her behaviour would have
been identical with the princess’s—she would
have tried to brazen it through and make him think
himself mistaken. They were one and the same,
he decided; two such rare women, so similar, could
not exist. And if they were the same, he could well
understand why she had feared him and caused
his capture. He had known her in the role of
revolutionist, there was likelihood of his meeting
her as Princess Valenko—and his discovery of
their identicality would, as her fear viewed it, be
disaster for her.</p>

<p>He at length shaped a plan, based on his love for
her, on his desire to relieve her of her needless fear,
and on the constant danger in which he stood.
That afternoon he drove to the Princess Valenko’s.
On the way he gave a look over his shoulder. A
block behind in a sleigh he saw two men wrapped to
the eyes, yet not so bundled up but that he recognized
Ivan and Nicolai; and near them in another sleigh
were two other men whom he instinctively felt to
be their confederates.</p>

<p>Before his ring at the Valenko palace had been
answered, he saw the two sleighs draw up across
the street half a block ahead. Once admitted,
he had not long to wait, but was ushered up a broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
stairway into a great front drawing-room. He had
hoped to find the princess alone; great, therefore,
was his disappointment when he found himself with
four gorgeous young officers and three women, all
centring about her.</p>

<p>Without rising she gave him her hand, and smiled
with distant, condescending friendship. “Ah—the
American who is almost my relative,” she said
in French; and proceeded with imperious languor
to introduce him to the women and to the immaculate,
gilded officers, to all of whom he bowed—though
the latter he inwardly cursed as the brainless
handiwork of tailors and valets.</p>

<p>She smiled amusedly into his face, and then about
at the others. “He thinks, my almost relative”—with
a little gesture toward him—“that he met me
a few days ago here in St. Petersburg. And that—in
what manner he has not said—he misconducted
himself on that occasion. And that he shares some
great secret of mine.”</p>

<p>Drexel fairly gasped. She had flung away her
secret—and there she sat, easy, unconcerned,
smiling.</p>

<p>“But impossible!” cried one of the officers.
“The princess has been abroad since August.”</p>

<p>“Why it is simply absurd, monsieur,” said a
stupid-looking, richly-dressed woman. “You remember,
Olga—” this to the princess—“it’s only two
weeks since you and I heard Tannhäuser together
in Berlin. Ugh—what a wretched Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
she was! And we came back yesterday from
Berlin on the same train!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the princess, smiling her slight,
amused smile at Drexel. “But still I would not
think of disputing the matter with Monsieur Drexel.
Americans are so clever, you know.”</p>

<p>They all laughed at this. Drexel felt his conclusions
going all to pieces, felt himself plunged
again into the old uncertainty.</p>

<p>“Just a stupid mistake on my part, of course,”
he said, rather doggedly. “I hope the princess will
pardon me.”</p>

<p>After that the talk ran back to its subject before
Drexel had entered—welcome to the princess—gossip
about this person and that—chat about
functions to come. Drexel was left quite out of
the conversation, but this gave him time to form
a determination to outstay all the others and have
it out with the princess in private. This plan,
however, was not so easy of achievement. The
others, to be sure, took their leave in ones and
pairs, but more callers came in their stead. He got
a polite glance from the princess now and then,
which, being interpreted, meant that he had far
exceeded the limits of a call. But he sat grimly on.</p>

<p>At length he had his reward. But he was certain
of having her to himself for no more than a moment,
so the instant the last back was out of the door he
drew his chair before her, leaned forward, and
looked her squarely in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Princess,” said he in English, “you have
the makings of the greatest poker player in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Pokair playair!” returned she in her halting
English. Her face was puzzled. “I not understand.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what a ‘bluffer’ is?”</p>

<p>“‘Bluffair’? Yes, I know. A vair American
word.”</p>

<p>“Well, you could make the biggest bluffer in
America seem a naïve child.”</p>

<p>“Excuse”—with a shrug. “What you mean?”</p>

<p>He spoke with sharp decision. “Your pretending
not to know me, and all the rest, is what
we would call a bluff. You are the woman I met
on the railroad train six nights ago. You are the
woman I talked with five nights ago. I know!
There’s no use denying it!”</p>

<p>Her eyes did not flinch from his determined gaze;
rather they took on a bored look.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said she quietly, “perhaps Meestair
Drexel is one—what you call it—one bluffair?”</p>

<p>Drexel was not at all certain he was not just that.
But his face showed none of his doubt.</p>

<p>“You are afraid of me because chance revealed
to me your secret,” he went on. “Now I have come
here to tell you that you have no reason to fear me.
To tell you that you can trust me.”</p>

<p>She rose and looked at him haughtily. “You
carry your amusement too far,” she said, lapsing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
into French. “I am tired. I beg that you will
excuse me.”</p>

<p>She started to sweep out of the room, but Drexel
blocked her way.</p>

<p>“I have come to tell you,” he went on doggedly,
“that to relieve you of any sense of danger from me,
I am willing, this minute, to yield myself your
prisoner, to be held as long as you desire.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me pass!” said she.</p>

<p>“As soon as you have answered me.”</p>

<p>Her lips curled with contempt. “Even were I
what you say, even had I the wish to take you
prisoner, how could I take and hold you in this
house? Again you must excuse me.”</p>

<p>He blocked her way once more. “At least, you
will cross with me to the window?”</p>

<p>“If you will then be so kind—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will then go, princess. Come!”</p>

<p>He crossed the drawing-room, parted the curtains
at one of the windows, and pointed down to where
along the river-wall, through the falling twilight,
could be seen the two sleighs.</p>

<p>“In those sleighs, princess,” said he, “Ivan and
Nicolai—you know them—followed me here.
They and two others. See that man lounging across
the street; that is Ivan, waiting for me to come out.
I desire that you shall have no fear of me. So I
am going over there to deliver myself back into
their hands. I will send a note to my people saying
I have been called to Moscow on business for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
indefinite time. That is all. I wish you good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>With that he bowed, and not waiting for a
reply he strode from the room. Two minutes
later he was across the street and beside one of
the sleighs.</p>

<p>“Hello, comrades!” he cried with a reckless laugh.
“Get in. I’m going with you.”</p>

<p>Nicolai and Ivan eyed him with silent suspicion,
but they crawled in, one on either side. The
sleigh was so narrow that Drexel had to sit upon
their knees.</p>

<p>“Now, comrades,” he went on, as they were
drawing the robes high about them, “as I’m going
to be a guest at that hotel of yours for some time,
let’s stop along the way and get a mattress that
isn’t paved with cobblestones. I don’t exactly fancy— Hello!
What’s that?”</p>

<p>A blunt object had suddenly been thrust against
the middle of his back.</p>

<p>“That,” explained Ivan, “is the muzzle of your
Browning.”</p>

<p>“If you’re going to return my property,” said
Drexel, “I wish you’d return it by some less direct
route. You might hand it around me, for instance.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know your game,” said Nicolai, “but
if you make one suspicious move, or one cry, that
pistol will go off.”</p>

<p>“All right. But say there, Ivan, be careful,
will you! I’ve got used to that spinal column of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
mine, and if you spoiled it I might never get another
that suited me as well. Drive on.”</p>

<p>The horse started up. But before it had fairly
swung into a trot, some one running behind cried
out, “Wait! Wait!”</p>

<p>They drew up, and a man thrust a piece of paper
into Nicolai’s hand and immediately turned back.
Nicolai opened the paper and glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Of all the strange things!” he cried, and turned
the paper over to Ivan.</p>

<p>“The devil!” exclaimed Ivan. “Where did
it come from?”</p>

<p>“The man who brought it looks like a servant,”
said Nicolai, who was peering over his shoulder.
“He is entering that great house.”</p>

<p>“More wonderful still!” cried Ivan. “But the
writing is certainly hers!”</p>

<p>“And the signature! And an order is an order.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“See here, boys,” spoke up the mystified Drexel.
“What does all this mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Nicolai, as he threw open
the robes. “But the order says you are to go back
to the person you were talking to.”</p>

<p>Drexel sprang from the sleigh. “Good-bye,”
he shouted, and made for the Valenko door.</p>

<p>The footman ushered him up past the drawing-room,
where he had so lately sat, and in which he
glimpsed several new callers, and on back into a
small rear drawing-room. Here an open fire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
blazing, and beside it stood the tall slender figure
of the princess, the same haughty, magnificent
pride in her bearing. She did not give Drexel a
look. He paused within the door, wondering,
palpitant.</p>

<p>“Andrei,” said she to the footman, “give my
excuses to any persons waiting and any who may
come, and say that for the present I am engaged.”</p>

<p>“Yes, princess.”</p>

<p>“And, Andrei—shut the door.”</p>

<p>“Yes, princess.”</p>

<p>As the door closed the pride and hauteur suddenly
faded out of her, and there she was smiling at him
brightly, half-mischievously.</p>

<p>“Well, John—” said she, in easy English.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>“YOU AND I—AGAINST THE WORLD”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE drew slowly near her.</p>

<p>“So after all, you are——”</p>

<p>The smile grew more mischievous.
“Mary Davis, of course. Whom did you think?”</p>

<p>He was pulsing with exultant wildness; but he
knew well that he had to hold himself under control.</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “you at last trust me?”</p>

<p>“What you were just about to do proved your
sincerity. I could not let you go further with it.
But come—please sit down.”</p>

<p>He first pushed a chair for her before the fireplace,
then drew one up beside her. Her smile sobered
and she looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I can trust you. There are your
actions as proof. And then, had you wanted to
betray me, you have had plenty of time to do so.
Our ideals are separated by the width of the world—but
I trust your honour.”</p>

<p>“You can indeed!” was all he could say.</p>

<p>Her smile came back. Till this last minute he
had never seen her really smile, so had never seen
but half her beauty.</p>

<p>“If I am not mistaken, you are a little curious?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“I am dumbfounded!”</p>

<p>“You know so much already, there is no reason
you should not know more—provided it goes no
further than yourself. First question?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know where to begin. Five days
ago I saw you in St. Petersburg. Yet it seems that
all the while you have been in Berlin. I think I
can make a guess at the explanation, but——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s simple enough. First let me say that
I was supposed to be abroad for pleasure; in reality
I was there on business affairs of the revolutionists.
Two weeks ago I suddenly announced that I was
leaving Berlin to visit a friend in France. I am
known as very self-willed; that explains and excuses
much. I secretly entered Russia, as a poor student,
on a false passport. When I left you, five nights
ago, I took a train; three days ago I reappeared
in Berlin from my French visit; the next day I set
out for Russia.”</p>

<p>“That’s much as I guessed,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“I would have remained here in disguise longer,”
she continued, “but last night’s ball had been long
arranged for, the invitations had been out for a
month, and I had already once postponed my homecoming.
To postpone it further was impossible.”</p>

<p>“But why did you, and not some less important
person, undertake that dangerous mission at Prince
Berloff’s?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons. First, I was best qualified.
And then——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>She paused and gazed at him keenly. “Yes,
I shall tell you that. You know the Government
does not know who the prisoner Borodin is.”</p>

<p>“So I have been told.”</p>

<p>“And only half a dozen persons do know who he
is. You have heard that I have an older brother?”</p>

<p>“Who became involved with the revolutionists
and disappeared four or five years ago. And how
your father—”</p>

<p>“Yes, to have a revolutionist in his family—that
almost broke my father’s proud heart. Well—Borodin
is my brother.”</p>

<p>“Your brother!” Drexel ejaculated. “Ah, I
see now why you were ready to risk so many dangers.
To save your brother!”</p>

<p>“To save my brother. And to save a leader whom
the cause of liberty cannot spare.”</p>

<p>“You must love him.”</p>

<p>“Dearly!” said she, and her blue eyes lighted
up. “He is so noble, single-hearted, brilliant!”</p>

<p>“But your father does not guess that Borodin
is his son?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And of course he does not know what you are
at heart, what you have done?”</p>

<p>“No. If he knew!” Her face saddened. “And
sometime he must know, for I cannot always successfully
play this double part.”</p>

<p>Drexel, remembering the stern, proud old man,
and knowing the love that existed between the two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
could but wonder what would happen on that day
when the general should learn the truth.</p>

<p>“It was the news of my brother’s arrest that
brought me flying back to Russia,” she went on.
“I was best fitted for the mission of going to Prince
Berloff’s house.”</p>

<p>“But was it necessary for you to go to Berloff’s?”
he broke in. “Could you not have learned,
without risk, Borodin’s whereabouts from your
father?”</p>

<p>“My father did not know and does not know.
The heads of the secret police were, for their own
purpose, keeping the place of his imprisonment a
close secret. I was best suited for going to Prince
Berloff’s because, while my father was governor
of a Siberian province, Prince Berloff was in a way
my guardian. I once lived at his house, and since
then I have visited there much, though not recently.
So I knew his house, and knew it well. I planned
my call at a time when I knew he was expected to
be absent for a few hours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the servants,” said Drexel. “There
was the danger that you might be recognized by
them.”</p>

<p>“But none had ever seen me before. He changes
his servants every few months.”</p>

<p>“Changes them?”</p>

<p>“That they may not learn too much and begin
to suspect.”</p>

<p>“Suspect?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Yes. Who he is. Rather, what he is.”</p>

<p>“And what is he?”</p>

<p>She gazed at him steadily a moment. “Prince
Berloff is the actual head of Russia’s spy
system.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Drexel. And he sprang to his
feet and stared at her.</p>

<p>“The master of Russia’s hundred thousand human
bloodhounds,” she went on with a sudden fierce
abhorrence. “The cunningest, cruellest, most unscrupulous
man between Germany and the Pacific
Ocean!”</p>

<p>“And this is the man that my cousin—” He
looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she. “And the man I would have
married, too, could my father have had his way.
He was after my money, just as he is after your
cousin’s. His ambition knows no limit—nor his
unscrupulousness. He uses his office to further
his own ends. If any stand in the way of his ambition,
his control of the infamous machinery of the
secret police gives him power to do away with them
in a dozen ways—by death, exile, or imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“And he has done that?”</p>

<p>“Again and again. He would wipe me out of
existence without a moment’s hesitation could he
safely do it; with my brother outlawed, that would
make him heir to my father’s estate. He will either
be Russia’s prime minister, or else, before then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
some terrorist—” The lifting of her shoulders
spoke the rest.</p>

<p>A mystery that had puzzled Drexel for near a
week was suddenly illumined. “I see now why you
feared me, that night in the hotel, when I told you
who I was!”</p>

<p>“Yes. The friend, the guest, the kinsman of
Prince Berloff seemed indeed a man to flee from.”</p>

<p>“To think that we have never guessed what he
is!”</p>

<p>“Only a very few in the Government know the
office he fills, and only a few of us. He works
through one or two trusty subordinates who are
nominally the head of the system.”</p>

<p>“But what are his reasons for this concealment?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, since no one suspects what he
is, he can work more craftily. In the second place—well,
you can guess that a chief of spies is not exactly
a popular idol. Von Plevhe spent a million rubles
a year to protect his person, and even with that
he died by a terrorist’s bomb. Instead of defending
himself by the vain expenditure of a million on
personal guards, Prince Berloff defends himself
by keeping his hated office a secret.”</p>

<p>“I see. But why have you revolutionists not
exposed him?”</p>

<p>“We have kept the matter a secret for much the
same reason that he has kept it secret. So long as
he believes himself unsuspected, we can work all
the better against him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>He stared at her. He remembered how calmly,
how haughtily she had stood beside Prince Berloff,
who had never a thought that the woman upon his
arm was his bitter enemy, was fighting him with
her very wit. And then, with a thrill of wonderment,
he began to consider what a marvel it was
that this young woman who had everything—great
wealth, princely birth, such homage as was given
to but few in a nation—everything that the world
prized, should care so little for them all.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand, princess—” he began
slowly.</p>

<p>“Do not call me princess!” she interrupted, her
face beginning to glow. “I hate the word! Since
you know me for what I am, call me what my comrades
call me. Call me Sonya.”</p>

<p>“It is hard for me to understand then, how you
are willing to risk position, rank, wealth—”</p>

<p>She rose and stood before him, her beauty heightened
by the deepening glow of her face, by the flash
of her eyes.</p>

<p>“My position!” cried she, opening wide her
arms. “My position! What won me my position,
my rank, my wealth? I will tell you. A thousand
years ago, and more, one of my ancestors was a
strong man. He made himself great by seizing the
rights and property of others. The Government
helped him hold on to what he had seized, and during
all the thousand years since the Government has
helped his descendents hold on to that power and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
property and keep the disinherited ones, the robbed
ones, in subjection. And to-day it is helping me!</p>

<p>“People call me beautiful, cultured, noble. If
this be true, why is it true? Because for a thousand
years thousands of people have toiled, suffered,
starved, been beaten down! I am the product of
all that misery! Not for a day, not for an hour,
would I keep my position were it not for one thing
alone. I have a large income, all of which, except
what I need to maintain appearances, is now turned
over to the revolutionists; were I openly to join
the revolutionists, that money, which we need so
much, would be confiscated and lost to us. The
need of this money forces me to hold my place;
otherwise I would be openly in the fight to regain
the people their lost rights, to gain them rights they
have never had! To win their liberty, and all that
liberty will mean! Ah, the people! Our poor
maimed and mourning people!”</p>

<p>As she spoke there was a vague sense in Drexel
of the contrast between them: she the apex of old-world
aristocracy, giving her whole soul to the people;
he of the over-night American aristocracy, trampling
upon the people, giving his whole soul to winning
that which she would so gladly throw away. As
she finished, standing before him a-tremble with
sympathy and passion, her superb beauty illumined
by the inspiration of her purpose, he felt himself
fairly lifted to his feet; and thrilled, he stretched
out an eager hand to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“And I—I will help you!” he cried.</p>

<p>“You help?” Her lips half curled with scorn.
“You with such ideals as you expressed the other
night!”</p>

<p>“Never mind ideals! I will help!”</p>

<p>Those eyes of blue searched him narrowly.</p>

<p>“If not impelled to help by ideals, then by
what?”</p>

<p>He well knew by what; by her spirit, her personality,
by his love—but he cried:</p>

<p>“What impels me matters not, so long as I serve
well and ask no reward!”</p>

<p>She considered a space, then said slowly: “No,
we have no right to refuse any trustworthy aid.
And I know that I can trust you; and that you have
courage and readiness of wit. But, you have
counted the risk?”</p>

<p>“I am ready for the risk!”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment. “You know what we
are trying to do now. Our present endeavour is
but an incident of the great struggle; but the future
of the cause, the liberation of the people, depend
largely upon saving my brother from death.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow I go to Prince Berloff’s house party,
and so do you. The reason I accepted the invitation
was the opportunity offered for continuing the
search, interrupted the other day, for some document
revealing the whereabouts of my brother.
You could help me, and help me much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>She held out her hand. “Shall it be you and I
against Prince Berloff?”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand.</p>

<p>“You and I,” he half whispered, “against—”
He checked the words that rushed to his lips, but
they sounded through all his being: “Against the
world!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A BARGAIN IS RENEWED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next day they all went down to Prince
Berloff’s—the Howards, Sonya and her
father, Countess Baronova, Drexel, the
prince, and besides them half a dozen high-born
men and women who, Drexel soon discovered, had
the grace and polish of courtiers and ladies-in-waiting,
and a paste-jewel sparkle of talk, but who
were just narrowness and stupidity surfaced with
fine manners and fine clothes.</p>

<p>As Drexel had anticipated, Sonya wore toward
him an air of haughty negligence—an air that held
no faintest hint that they were on terms of friendship,
much less that between them was a secret pact.
He could but compare this cold creature of imperious
indifference that the world saw with the frank,
glowing, inspiring and inspired woman who the
afternoon before had opened her soul to him.
Though his uncle drew him aside and talked traction
deal, and though he nodded now and then,
Drexel took in hardly one of the fortune-pregnant
sentences; his mind was all with Sonya. But he
did not allow himself to think of love, though all
his being tingled with it. After the manner in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
he had proposed to her, offering to lift her to his
shining heights out of her poverty and insignificance,
he hardly dare again approach the subject. Besides,
for all his American pride, he felt her to be immeasurably
beyond his reach.</p>

<p>But if Sonya was distant, there was one who was
not. In the latter half of the short journey Mr.
Howard was summoned forward by his wife, and
Drexel was following his uncle, when he was met
in the corridor by Countess Baronova.</p>

<p>“I know your uncle was sent for; are you, too,
under orders?” she asked lightly, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I put you under orders. Come,
talk to me.”</p>

<p>He fell in with her playful spirit, and bowed with
an air that mocked the St. Petersburg courtiers.
“Madame, I obey.”</p>

<p>“Come, then.”</p>

<p>She led the way back to a compartment in the
rear of the car and they sat down facing each other.
She was in a travelling gown of black velvet with
long sweeping lines, and the black note was repeated
with staccato effect by the studs of jet in her ears,
and by her brilliant eyes; a darkly fascinating being
whose gaze was open and direct, whose clear-skinned
beauty was honest, owing not a tittle, as does most
noble St. Petersburg beauty, to the false testimony
of bleaching compounds and rouge-pots.</p>

<p>She leaned back with luxurious grace and smiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
at him with frank good humour. “I know I’m
very brazen to capture you in this manner, but
that’s the privilege of an elderly widow.”</p>

<p>“Elderly?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-seven, sir!”</p>

<p>“Then that puts me, too, in the decrepit class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a single man never grows too old for woman
to smile at. He’s comparatively immortal.”</p>

<p>“Hum. And the moral to that is——”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. Be mortal—for some one woman’s
sake. Thus the elderly widow advises. But besides
my old age,” she went on, “I have another excuse
for taking you prisoner. For a week or more
I’ve been waiting to have a little chat with
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve—ah—been in Moscow, you know,”
explained Drexel.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But now at last I have you at
my mercy.” Her smile faded away, her face leaned
nearer, and her rallying tone sank to a serious
whisper. “I want to talk on an important matter,
Mr. Drexel, and I am going to speak to you openly,
frankly. I can play the diplomat, but with a man
of affairs like you, I know it is best to come straight
to the point.”</p>

<p>Since he had first met the countess, Drexel had
known her as a popular figure in the brilliant society
frequented by the high officials that surround the
Czar and fill the ministries, by the smart and noble
officers of the Imperial Guard, by that ever-changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
influx of officers who, after representing for a year or
two the Czar’s autocratic might in some stupid,
provincial town, or in some remote army station,
come to St. Petersburg to renew themselves with
a few months of the capital’s thoughtless gaiety.
Yet he had guessed there was something beneath
her surface of society devotee. She had piqued
his curiosity, so now he felt a sudden flutter of
interest as he said, “Please go on.”</p>

<p>Her dark, lustrous eyes searched deep into his
own for a silent moment—then the elbow that
supported her smooth cheek slipped yet nearer
along the window-sill, and her voice dropped to
a yet softer tone.</p>

<p>“You are a man to be trusted. I put myself,
my life, in your hands.”</p>

<p>She glanced quickly at the door and back again.
“I am a revolutionist.”</p>

<p>“A revolutionist!” he breathed.</p>

<p>“All my soul is with those who fight the
Czar.”</p>

<p>He stared at her. Indeed, there was something
beneath the surface! And that two such women
as she and the princess should——</p>

<p>She interrupted his surprise with her rapid, barely
audible words. “There is a noble part open to
you, if you will only take it.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“To help us.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“You have heard about Borodin—his arrest—what
he means to the revolutionary cause?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“To rescue him is what at this moment we revolutionists
desire most of all to do. If you would join
us in that attempt, our chance of success would be
greatly increased.”</p>

<p>“Increased? How?”</p>

<p>“You are shrewd,” she whispered. “And you
could attempt bolder things than other men, for,
your position being what it is, no one would suspect
you. Yes, you could do much—much!”</p>

<p>She took his silence as a wish for something
further before he answered. “If you will be with
us I can arrange for you to meet our active leaders
at once, and take part in their secret plannings.
I can see from your face that you are wondering
what, in return for all this, will be your reward.
You would have a life-long sense of having helped
a struggling nation to win the light.”</p>

<p>She hesitated—a soft red tinged her cheeks—her
eyes fluttered down.</p>

<p>“And if the—the gratitude of a simple woman
will mean anything—that gratitude you would
ever have.”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking what she meant. Here
was a situation, indeed, for a man newly in love!
In his embarrassment Drexel knew not what to
say that would carry him swiftly and safely by this
delicate crisis in a manner to give no offense to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
countess, whom he liked and admired. He was
floundering about in his mind for the proper phrase
when she raised her bright, flushed face and met
his gaze frankly.</p>

<p>“If you decide to be with us,” she went on, “I
have a definite plan to suggest—one calling for
immediate action. A plan I, personally, am trying
to carry through. I am sure we could make it
succeed—you and I.”</p>

<p>All her warm, excited beauty, all her fascination,
were directed at him. He hardly knew how to parry.</p>

<p>“Before I decide,” he temporized, “I should want
to know what the plan is.”</p>

<p>“Lean nearer. It is this. I am trying—s-s-sh!
Some one is coming! I’ll tell you later, when the
person goes.”</p>

<p>Her voice and face were all disappointment, but
when Mr. Howard walked into the compartment,
she greeted him with an easy, good-humoured
smile. However, her plan Drexel was not then to
know, for the journey ended without giving her an
opportunity to finish what she had begun.</p>

<p>At the station were waiting four two-seated sleighs,
each with three splendid blacks hitched abreast.
It fell out that Drexel, the countess, Sonya and
Berloff got into one sleigh, Sonya and Berloff in
the front seat. As they flashed over the flat white
country, tucked away in frozen sleep, Drexel involuntarily
compared these two women, the one he
did not love and felt sure he could have, and the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
he did love and knew he could not have—both
beautiful, both clever, both so different from what
they seemed to the world—both involved in the
dangerous underground struggle against the Czar.</p>

<p>He could but notice with what ease Sonya talked
with Berloff, that powerful antagonist with whom
she was in deadly duel. He studied Berloff anew
in the light of her startling revelation, and he saw
anew the power, the resourcefulness, the relentless
cunning behind that pale, refined face. In a struggle
of wits against wits, he was an adversary that only
the cleverest could hope to hold his own against.
Moreover, he did not fight alone. Fighting with
him, and for him, was his own army of near a hundred
thousand spies, and besides these was the million
of the standing army, and all the vast civil machinery
of the State. Drexel drew a long breath.</p>

<p>The prince’s mansion sat in a great park of snow-drooped
evergreens. It was a big, box-like, sprawling
pile, as are most of the older country seats of
the Russian nobility, but the plainness of its exterior
prepared a surprise for him who entered for the first
time. The furnishings were rich and quiet in
their tone; the walls of the main rooms were hung
with paintings, studies, etchings, chiefly works from
the hands of the big Frenchmen of the nineteenth
century; and everywhere were exquisite little bronzes,
the best private collection in Russia. Berloff, so
said his friends, could have been an eminent artist
himself, had birth not destined him to greater things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Drexel’s eyes were ever covertly watching Sonya—thrilled
with the sense that he alone of all here knew
the double part she played. Sonya at once became
the dominant figure of the party. She did not
seek attention, rather she seemed to disdain it;
but, nevertheless, it focussed upon her, and with
a magnificent indifference she accepted it as her due.</p>

<p>In the evening, when they were all in the music
room, the countess surprised one of Drexel’s
surreptitious glances at Sonya. “You seem to think
with the rest of the men, that there is only one
woman present, the princess,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I had heard so much of her that I was curious,”
Drexel returned.</p>

<p>“Allow the elderly widow to tell you that attention
paid the princess is attention wasted. She will
smile on nothing less than royal blood. Since we
left Petersburg she has given you one casual glance
and two casual words. Are my statistics correct?”</p>

<p>“They agree with my own.”</p>

<p>Her voice sank to a bare whisper. “And of course
you know she has no sympathy with our movement
to gain freedom. She believes in the divine rights
of the high-born—that they are superior and should
rule and have the earth, and that the many should be
their footstool.”</p>

<p>He saw it was her wish to draw him into some
retired corner and continue the conversation of the
train; but this was not permitted her, for just then
the debonair young lieutenant of the Czar’s Guards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
who had been tripping airily among the perfumed
heights of tenor arias from the Italian opera, left
the piano, and there arose a demand that she should
sing. In rebuke to these sweet soulless intricacies,
so it seemed to Drexel, she sang several of the folk
songs of little Russia—simple, plaintive airs that
were the voice of the people’s heart speaking its
joys and woes and aspirations—and sang them
in a rich and soft contralto charged with feeling.</p>

<p>Drexel, stirred by her voice, felt his heart pulsing
in warm sympathy with the beat of the song. The
applauding guests thought she was moved by mere
artistic sentiment. He knew better, and when he
had a moment alone with her after she had finished,
he told her how truly splendid had been her singing.
She caught the sympathy in his voice and flashed
at him a quick, bright look. “We’ll have you yet!”
she whispered.</p>

<p>Prince Berloff, coming up, reminded her that
he had promised to show her some new etchings
that he had shown the other guests in the afternoon
while she had been lying down, and he led her off
to the library.</p>

<p>Could Drexel have only followed her!</p>

<p>The countess bestowed herself in a corner of a
great leather divan, leaning back in luxurious grace,
her cheek in one finely modeled hand. The prince
closed the door and drew up a chair in front of her.
There was controlled eagerness in his pale face.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked in his low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Triumph gleamed through the fringe of her half-closed
eyes, but her manner was languorously
reposeful.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we have him!”</p>

<p>“A-a-h!” breathed the prince. “You have
definitely involved him in some plan?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I’m leading him gently toward one.
But he’s ready. He said as much to-night.”</p>

<p>“Good! And what plan?”</p>

<p>“I thought the one we knew was uppermost in
the revolutionists’ minds would be the best—the
freeing of Borodin.”</p>

<p>“You must use haste. Drexel is to be in Russia
less than two weeks longer. When are you going
to lead him definitely into the thing?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” she answered.</p>

<p>“On what?”</p>

<p>“On you.”</p>

<p>“On me?”</p>

<p>“On the reply you make to a pair of requests.”</p>

<p>“And what are they?”</p>

<p>“When you arranged with me to undertake this
matter, you merely ordered me to lead Mr. Drexel
into some revolutionary plot. You did not tell me
why you wanted him to be involved in a plot, and
I did not ask. But I ask now.”</p>

<p>The prince’s white brows drew together. “Countess,
you are going too far!”</p>

<p>But the menace of his looks did not even ripple
the countess’s repose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Then you refuse?”</p>

<p>“Most emphatically!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, this first request was of minor
importance,” she said easily. “And besides, for
that matter, I know my question’s answer.”</p>

<p>He gave a slight start, then his face was again a
cold mask.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” he said calmly. “How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could not help doing a little thinking—guessing—putting
this and that together.”</p>

<p>“And my purpose?”</p>

<p>“To get Mr. Drexel out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And get him out of the way so that no suspicion or
blame could attach to you,” she went on. “Get him
involved in some revolutionary plot you were watching,
have the gendarmes break in upon the plotters
and kill Mr. Drexel in the struggle, or have him
immediately executed with the others before his
identity should be learned. Then when his fate
became known, the Government would be very
sorry—but really, you know, no one would be to
blame but Mr. Drexel’s own rashness. And you
could be very sympathetic with his family, and they
would never guess that you were the man behind it.
Very safe, prince—and very, very clever!”</p>

<p>The prince’s face was still a cold, impenetrable
mask.</p>

<p>“Am I not right?”</p>

<p>“I do not choose to discuss my purpose,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Her head slowly nodded. “Oh, I am right!”
She gazed into his face with keen, analyzing thought.
“They say Richard the Third of England murdered
cousins, uncles, all sorts of relatives, to get to the
throne. Our own Catherine the Great had her
husband, Czar Paul, killed that she might become
ruler of Russia. You have a family likeness to
them, prince. I should not care to stand between
you and anything you desire.”</p>

<p>“I have not noticed any particular strain of
tenderness in the Countess Baronova,” he returned
dryly. “You spoke of a second request.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The important one. If I am to go ahead,
you must pay me more.”</p>

<p>“Pay you more! I have offered you ten thousand
rubles for this above your regular salary!”</p>

<p>“I know. I must have fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand! Never!”</p>

<p>“You are in earnest?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Of course! I have thousands of persons who
will do this for what I offered you—or a tenth
the sum.”</p>

<p>“But do it as well? Anyone else who could
draw him into a revolutionary plot—so that it
will be safe for you—so that the blame will all be
on him? Eh, prince?”</p>

<p>“Your demand is absurd!” he said.</p>

<p>“Then I will go no further with Mr. Drexel.
You and I are through with this matter, I suppose.
Well, I’m quite as well pleased with your refusal.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
She started to rise. “Let us return to the
others.”</p>

<p>“Wait, sit down,” he said sharply. She did so.
“Tell me why you are just as well pleased with my
refusal?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said she calmly, “it may be in my
mind that by breaking with you I may get something
I prefer above your fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“I do not choose to discuss my purpose,” she
said, mimicking his cold sentence of a moment
before.</p>

<p>At this “checkmate” he bit the inner edge of his
thin lip.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d just as soon tell you,” she went on.
“The fact is, I’m getting tired of my work. Not
tired of the pleasure of society, nor tired of my
particular friends, the young officers who come to
St. Petersburg to spend their furloughs. But tired
of having it whispered about secretly that I have
liberal views, and thereby drawing to me the officers
who hold revolutionary opinions. Tired of sympathetically
leading them on, little by little, to confide
in me. Tired of telling you, and having them
disappear—poor fellows!”</p>

<p>“Um. What would have been the position of
the widow of the bankrupt Count Baronoff but for
this salary?”</p>

<p>“I have needed the money, yes. But now, I’m
tired. Besides, if I’m found out, or if a few wrinkles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
come, my usefulness to you is over and the salary
stops. I’ve been doing a little serious thinking,
and here’s what I’ve decided. If I have so infatuated
Mr. Drexel that I can lead him into a plot that
will make him your victim, why should I not——”</p>

<p>She stopped, and her eyes gleamed tantalizingly
at the prince.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, instead of that, why should I not make
myself your cousin?”</p>

<p>“You mean marry him?”</p>

<p>“He’s rich—has a big career before him—and
I rather like him. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” cried the prince in a low, harsh
voice, leaning towards her. “Because I will not
have my plans interfered with! Because I will
not have you for a relative!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the compliment, prince,” she said
dryly. “But how will you prevent it?”</p>

<p>“By telling him what you are—the cleverest,
keenest, most heartless woman spy in Russia!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I also might tell something.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I might tell Miss Howard who you are—the
ruthless, secret——”</p>

<p>He rose and stood above her, his eyes glittering.</p>

<p>“Be careful, countess,” he said slowly, ominously.
“You yourself have said that I would hesitate at
nothing. Well, be warned by your own words!”</p>

<p>Her daring had carried her too far. She knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
this man, and knew that if he but willed it she would
mysteriously disappear never to be seen again. Her
face kept its calm, but inwardly she could but flinch
before the dark menace of his look.</p>

<p>After a moment, she spoke again.</p>

<p>“I think we will both go farther, prince, if we go
together and in harmony. Come, which is it to be—fifty
thousand—or am I to withdraw from the
affair?”</p>

<p>Berloff did not answer at once; then he said:</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said she.</p>

<p>“But you must finish this at once.”</p>

<p>“I’ll claim the money within three days.” She
rose and took his arm. “Come, let us go back to
the others.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later she was again with Drexel,
trying with look and veiled words to win his sympathy
for her cause.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>IN THE PRINCE’S STUDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER several more of the countess’s songs
of Little Russia, and more vocal trapeze
work by the lieutenant among his Italian
arias, the company adjourned to the hall, a room so
large that a fair-sized house could have been erected
therein. Here tables had been placed, and the
company eagerly set about playing cards, the great
pastime of the <i>blasé</i> Russian nobility. The stakes
were moderate, Berloff purposely announcing a low
limit that none might leave his house with feelings
of regret; but nevertheless the play continued with
a silent intensity far into the morning hours.</p>

<p>The countess tried in vain to have a few minutes
alone with Drexel during the evening. The next
morning, however, she was more fortunate, for when
she came down at eleven for her tea and two sugared
rolls she found Drexel alone in the breakfast room—no
other of the guests had as yet appeared. She
assumed command of the great silver samovar,
which would be steaming all day, and made Drexel
a fresh glass of tea. When she had said the night
before to Berloff that she liked Drexel, she had
spoken more of truth than the prince imagined—more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> 
perhaps, than even she herself was aware
of—and this liking lent a peculiar excitement, a
tang, to the game she was now playing.</p>

<p>Before two minutes had passed she had led the
talk to Borodin. To shrewd, hard-headed Henry
Drexel, whose secret pride it had always been that
no one had ever bested him in the game of wits,
this frank, handsome woman seemed flushed with
excited devotion to her cause. He had a momentary
impulse to avoid the risk of working at cross
purposes by taking her as an ally into his and Sonya’s
plan; but he was restrained by the sense that to do
so would be to reveal Sonya’s secret to a third person,
and none but she had that right. On the other
hand to tell the countess he was not interested
would have been false to his attitude—so he
temporized.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Borodin is imprisoned?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No—not yet.”</p>

<p>“Should not your first effort be to find out?”</p>

<p>“It is going to be.”</p>

<p>Drexel did some quick thinking. Perhaps she had
some information worth knowing. “Where do you
think his whereabouts can be learned?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“There is undoubtedly a record of it in the Ministry
of the Interior.”</p>

<p>“But the difficulty of getting it!”</p>

<p>“I know. But we have plans for searching the
ministry’s records.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>He hesitated; then in his eagerness he went farther
than he had intended.</p>

<p>“But might there not be some easier, simpler
plan?”</p>

<p>“How? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I have been doing some thinking—ah—apropos
of what you said. Is there not some man
intimate with the secrets of the Government who
may have record of Borodin?”</p>

<p>“Like whom?”</p>

<p>“Well, say like our host. I merely use him for
an illustration. He seems to be informed on every
detail of what the Government does.”</p>

<p>The countess’s quick mind decided that if this
idea interested him, it would be well to lure him on
through that interest. “Yes,” she returned, nodding
her head. “I think you may be right. And
as for the prince, he may be the very man. It is
entirely possible he may know where Borodin is.”</p>

<p>She leaned nearer, and her manner was excitedly
joyous. “Since you have been doing this thinking,
that means you are at heart already one of us!”</p>

<p>“I am not saying yet, countess,” he smiled.</p>

<p>The voices of Prince Berloff and Mr. Howard
sounded without.</p>

<p>“Come—you will be with us!” she said quickly,
appealingly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.” And then, half ashamed of his
enforced reticence, he whispered: “Who knows?
I may do all you ask—some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Her eyes glowed into his. “Ah—thank you!”
she breathed as the others entered.</p>

<p>Drexel excused himself, leaving the countess
pouring tea for the two men, and withdrew into the
hall, where under pretense of examining some etchings
from Corot he kept watch upon the broad
staircase. As he had hoped, Sonya soon came down
the stairway, alone. She responded to his “Good-morning,
princess,” with a formal smile.</p>

<p>“What kind of a day is it?” she asked perfunctorily,
and crossed into the embrasure of a window
and gazed out into the park. He followed her,
half doubtful if there really was the secret tie of a
common purpose between this haughty being and
himself. But once within the alcove she smiled
at him again—this time a comradely, half-whimsical
smile.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, how do you feel now about being in the
lion’s den?”</p>

<p>“Like getting out as soon as we get what we want.”</p>

<p>“Then you are ready to go on?”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a man who wishes to withdraw?”</p>

<p>She searched his face with its quiet, determined
eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, and a warm glow went
through him.</p>

<p>The countess’s recent words were strong upon him.
He was curious to learn Sonya’s impression, and
there was not the same reason for absolute secrecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
in the countess’s case as there was in Sonya’s.
“Tell me, what do you know of Countess Baronova?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No more than you probably do.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, not so much. We have—well—been
friends, and have had many talks. And at
last, after working her way toward it, she has confided
to me that she is secretly a revolutionist.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! But I really cannot say that I am surprised.
She is just another example of how the
revolt against the Government is penetrating even
the nobility. But why did she tell you?”</p>

<p>“To try to enlist my aid in some such plan as we
now have in hand. She thought because of my
peculiar situation I could be of exceptional assistance.”
He did not want the countess as a third
partner in the scheme—he wanted to carry this
thing through alone with Sonya; so he quickly added:
“But I suppose there is no reason for our taking her
in.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “It is always unwise to take
in a single unnecessary person—and especially a
person who has not been tested.”</p>

<p>“When shall we make the trial?”</p>

<p>“To-day. We must watch till the prince and all
the others are occupied in some distant part of the
house. Perhaps there will be an opportunity before
the rest come down—that might be our best chance.”</p>

<p>But this last was not to be. After breakfast the
prince excused himself, saying that he had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
papers to which he was forced to give immediate
consideration, and withdraw to his study, the very
room Drexel and Sonya were to search. Moreover,
Alice wanted her father to see something of the
estate which was to be her main country seat, and
since she had a headache and her mother felt disinclined
to brave the cold, it fell upon Drexel to accompany
Mr. Howard. Until two o’clock the pair of
them, barricaded against the cold with layers of furs,
and drawn by three swift blacks, flew across broad
fields, through long, huddling villages, past forests
of snow-shrouded pine and spruce and hemlock.</p>

<p>Half an hour before the afternoon dinner Drexel
and Sonya had another moment together in the
embrasure of the window. After this interview
Drexel went out to make a solitary inspection of the
prince’s famous stable, asking them to excuse him,
as he had nibbled rather generously after his drive
and so was not hungry. Just before dinner was
announced Sonya, pleading a slight indisposition,
retired to her room. Minus these two, the company
filed into the dining-room.</p>

<p>They were midway in the first course when Drexel
returned to the house, slipped quietly through the
corridor that led to the library, and taking a book
at hazard from the French section, settled himself
in one of the leather chairs. A few minutes later
Sonya entered.</p>

<p>“That is the study there,” she said quickly, leading
the way through a door opening off the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>They had decided there was no necessity for one
to keep guard; the records were in French, as
Sonya knew, and they could make double speed
by searching together. In case anyone interrupted
them, Sonya was to remark casually that Drexel was
helping her look for a volume of genealogy.</p>

<p>The study was distinctly a workroom. There
were no vaults here, no heavily locked cupboards,
no air of secrecy, for all the prince’s work was done
upon the theory that the surest way to escape suspicion
of harbouring a secret is to make a quiet
show of having nothing to conceal. Shelves reaching
to the ceiling were crowded with the government
reports of a dozen nations, and with rows of
semi-official files. It was frankly the room of such
a man as Berloff appeared to be—a statesman
without a post, an unofficial adviser to the Czar.</p>

<p>“When here a week ago,” whispered Sonya, “I
barely got into this room when I had to fly. So we’ll
have to begin at the very beginning—on those
files.”</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, their ears quickened for the
faintest step, they set swiftly to work. The danger
was great; discovery for Sonya, at least, would mean
complete disaster.</p>

<p>As each file was examined it was thrust back, so
that in case they were suddenly interrupted there
might be no disorder to betray what they had been
about. There were digests of reports on the railroads,
on the peasants, on the wholesale corruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
in the army commissariat, on a hundred things of
vital interest to the statesman at large Berloff
ostensibly was—but nothing relating to what they
knew to be his real business.</p>

<p>“After all, he must have some secret hiding-place
for his records of the political police,” whispered
Drexel.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But we must first make sure they are
not here.”</p>

<p>The faint, musical jangling of bells without
caused Drexel to glance through the window. Already
the brief daylight was beginning to wane.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Sonya.</p>

<p>“A sleigh driving up with one man in it. Another
guest, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Sonya, who had been turning swiftly through crop
reports from the Ministry of Agriculture, gave a low
cry and stared at a paper.</p>

<p>“We’re finding something! Think of it! Prince
Berloff was behind that attempt a month ago to kill
the prime minister with a bomb! The revolutionary
leader who urged it on was in reality one of his spies!”</p>

<p>“Berloff try to kill the prime minister! Why?”</p>

<p>“Because that would be to kill two birds with one
stone—make the revolutionists unpopular because
of their inhuman methods, and make vacant the
position he covets. But here are more! Examine
the bottom of the files.”</p>

<p>“Here it is!” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“What does it say? Quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Arrested in the dress of a railway porter——”</p>

<p>“But the prison!”</p>

<p>“Put in Central Prison.”</p>

<p>She gave a sharp moan of disappointment. “He
was put there at first. But we know he was secretly
removed to some other prison. Quick—we’ll find it!”</p>

<p>They went feverishly at the files. But suddenly
both straightened up. Indistinct voices were heard
in the corridor that opened into the library. In an
instant the files were back in their places and all
looked as before.</p>

<p>“I did not expect you to-day,” said a voice in the
library.</p>

<p>“Berloff!” whispered Drexel.</p>

<p>“We’ll carry it off before him,” said Sonya, confidently,
and she took down a volume of genealogy.</p>

<p>“Count Orloff was very eager you should have
the reports at once,” a rumbling bass responded to
Prince Berloff.</p>

<p>“That voice!” breathed Sonya.</p>

<p>“I, too, have heard it before! But where?”</p>

<p>The library filled with light. They crept to the
half-open door. Sonya put her eyes to the crack
and peered in. The next instant she had clutched
Drexel with tense, quivering hands and was drawing
him back. Even the deepening twilight could
not hide her sudden pallor.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” Drexel whispered.</p>

<p>“The captain of gendarmes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“The one who pursued us? Captain Nadson?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They stared at each other in deepest consternation.</p>

<p>“If he finds us here together——” breathed
Drexel.</p>

<p>“The destruction of our plans—trouble for you—ruin
for me, and who knows what worse!”</p>

<p>“We must escape, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but how?”</p>

<p>“The windows, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“They are double, and are screwed down. The
only way would be to break the glass. And then they
would seize us before we could get out.”</p>

<p>Drexel thought. “Our only chance then is that
they may go away without discovering us.”</p>

<p>“There is no other,” said she.</p>

<p>They crept back to the door, and this time Drexel
put his eyes to the crack. The big captain was in
the act of handing Berloff a large envelope.</p>

<p>“Here are the reports Count Orloff sent.”</p>

<p>“I suppose my advice is wanted soon?”</p>

<p>“Within two or three days, the count said.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can remain here until I have
my advice ready. For a couple of days.”</p>

<p>“Just as you order, Your Excellency.”</p>

<p>“Very well. And now what have you to report
concerning the young woman who made that
attempt here a week ago?”</p>

<p>“I regret to say, nothing, Your Excellency.”</p>

<p>“Not even a clue?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“She has completely disappeared. But her description
is in the hands of our men all over Russia.
We’ll get her sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“And the man who helped her? An American,
you said.”</p>

<p>“We have only his word for that. He probably
lied. He could have been English. As to him,
also nothing.”</p>

<p>“You have had the police departments of the
different cities send you the records of American and
English passports?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but these foreign passports only give the
age and the colour of one’s eyes and hair. That
helps little to identify a man—especially since
most of the Americans and Englishmen in Russia
are between twenty-five and thirty, which was
about the age of this woman’s confederate.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep after them, captain. There is
another little matter on which I desire further information
that I think you can give me, but I must
refer to the record in the case. It is in my study.
Come with me.”</p>

<p>The prince and Captain Nadson rose and started
for the study door.</p>

<p>“It’s all up!” whispered Drexel. “I’ll attack
them, and under cover of that you run.”</p>

<p>“No—no!” returned Sonya. “Don’t move—don’t
breathe!”</p>

<p>And to Drexel’s consternation she calmly swept
through the study door into the arms of the two men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>BETWEEN THREE FIRES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT SIGHT of her, Captain Nadson fell back
and stared.</p>

<p>“Prince Berloff!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>But Berloff, surprised at her appearance, did not
heed him. “Why, Olga,” he said, “I thought
you were indisposed, and lying down.”</p>

<p>Sonya, cool, haughty, ignored the captain as a
thing below her notice. “So I was,” she replied;
“but I felt a little better and a few minutes ago I
wandered in there to look at your genealogical library.
Here’s a volume that I find has some new things
about the Valenkos in the time of Ivan the Terrible.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would be well for you to eat
something?” inquired the prince.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall,” she said languidly.</p>

<p>“Boris will get you anything you wish. You will
excuse us. Come, captain.”</p>

<p>He started toward the door. Sonya was putting
out her hand, but it was Nadson who stopped him.</p>

<p>“A moment, prince. I want to speak to the
lady.”</p>

<p>The captain’s bearded face was a-quiver with
excitement. Sonya turned her eyes upon him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
now for the first time—a cool, inquiring look,
half amazed at his temerity in daring to address
her. Behind the door, all Drexel’s being stood at
pause.</p>

<p>“What does the gentleman wish to say?” Sonya
asked stiffly.</p>

<p>Triumph glittered in the officer’s eye. “I believe
I have seen madame before,” he said.</p>

<p>“Very likely. Many persons have.”</p>

<p>“And recently. Only a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah!—then monsieur has just come from
abroad.”</p>

<p>“I saw you in St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! This is very remarkable.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because only three days ago I returned from
abroad after an absence of five months.”</p>

<p>This effrontery was too much for the police
official. “It’s not true!” he blurted out.</p>

<p>Her face darkened. “What!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Captain—you forget yourself!” cut in the
sharp voice of Berloff.</p>

<p>“I do not understand the insolence of this underling
of yours, prince,” she said majestically. “I
do not care what he thinks or believes. I have
nothing more to say to him. If you desire to set
him right, you may.”</p>

<p>“Captain,” said the prince severely, “I myself
met her when she arrived.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“And from August until three days ago the
princess——”</p>

<p>“The princess!” ejaculated the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes. My cousin—the Princess Valenko.”</p>

<p>“The daughter of the military governor?”</p>

<p>“The same,” said the prince.</p>

<p>The stupid amazement on the face of the big
officer was a sight to see. This was quickly followed
by the sense of the danger to him of his heinous
blunder.</p>

<p>“I believe the captain said he had something to
say to me,” Sonya remarked with an awful hauteur
that completed the man’s discomfiture. “What is
it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—a mistake—I beg pardon,” stammered
the captain.</p>

<p>“You are sure you have nothing to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, princess—nothing—I assure you.
I ask a thousand pardons. Nothing.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Berloff, “we shall go on into
the study. Come on, captain.”</p>

<p>They started again toward the door. Drexel
crouched with tense muscles, determined to make
the best struggle that was in him.</p>

<p>But Sonya quietly slipped her hand through
Berloff’s arm. “Won’t you take me in to the dining-room?
It will be very stupid eating in that great
room alone.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” said the prince. “Captain,
please wait for me here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Certainly, certainly!” said the officer.</p>

<p>“Then come, Olga.”</p>

<p>The captain, with one hand on the back of the
leather chair in which he was going to be comfortable
for the next half-hour, bowed low to them.</p>

<p>“I trust the captain will not take his mistake too
much to heart,” said Sonya, her manner relenting
somewhat. “Perhaps he, too, would like something
to eat after his drive from the station?”</p>

<p>“No, no—don’t think of me, princess,” protested
the humbled officer. “I am not hungry—not
in the least.”</p>

<p>Sonya unbent a little more. “Then a glass of
tea?”</p>

<p>“No—really—thank you——”</p>

<p>Sonya unbent still more—was the least bit
gracious. “Come—let me give you a glass of tea
just to show that I bear no ill will.”</p>

<p>The captain flushed, gratified. “Well, just a
glass of tea.”</p>

<p>“Come, then”—and Sonya led the two men out.</p>

<p>Drexel waited a minute, then slipped into the
library. Already he had made one decision. If
he remained in the house, Captain Nadson would
be sure to see him. The captain might think himself
mistaken regarding Sonya’s identity, if nothing new
came to reawaken suspicion; but to see the exact
likeness of both his fugitives in the house—the finest
bluffing in the world would not avail to save them.</p>

<p>He must fly the house, and fly the house at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>But to leave that instant meant to abandon what
would likely be the only chance to learn the whereabouts
of Borodin—to abandon his precious, newly
made, uncemented friendship with Sonya. So he
made a second decision. Sonya would keep the
prince and Captain Nadson beside her for several
minutes. It was a great risk, but he would go on
with the search.</p>

<p>He hurried back to the files, first closing the shutters
and turning on the light, and went with feverish
rapidity through the documents, his ears strained
for the faintest approaching step. Paper after paper
he skimmed. His heart pounded as if it would burst
open his breast.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a start. He heard a light footfall,
a soft swish-swish—Sonya slipping back, he
guessed. But when he peeped into the other room
it was the countess he saw. She took down a book
and settled herself in a chair; evidently she had come
in here for a few minutes’ relief from the crowd.</p>

<p>Drexel hesitated a moment—then went back
to his work, and again the records of arrests, of exile,
of nefarious plots, flew beneath his nervous hands,
his eyes looking only for the name of Borodin.
Noiselessly files came out, their pages were turned,
then slipped back, while his strained fear counted the
seconds.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Drexel!” said a low voice behind him.</p>

<p>He whirled about. “Countess Baronova!” he
breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>She lightly crossed to him. “You are trying to
find out about Borodin?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you were in earnest in what you said this
morning—about being with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I am proud—proud! To have won you to us—and
so quickly!” she said softly, glowing upon
him. And this marvellously clever actress told in
her manner that the great infatuation for her which
had led him to this action was returned.</p>

<p>He did not disillusion her; to have done so would
have taken time and would have exposed Sonya.
“I must hurry,” he said, turning to his work. “I
may be interrupted any second.”</p>

<p>“And I will help you!” The next moment she,
too, was fluttering through the records—and again
she felt that peculiar tang of excitement, an excitement
not quite like any she had experienced before
in all her professional career.</p>

<p>She wondered if he had discovered what office
the prince held. “Is there anything,” she asked,
“that makes you think Prince Berloff especially may
possess the evidence we seek?”</p>

<p>He remembered Sonya’s statement that their
knowledge of Berloff’s position was a close
secret.</p>

<p>“He seems intimate with the Government, as I
told you,” he replied.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed. The two worked swiftly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
in silence. Finally Drexel straightened up with a
low cry of triumph.</p>

<p>“You have it?” asked the countess.</p>

<p>“Yes—at last!”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In the Fortress of Saints Peter and Paul! In
St. Petersburg!”</p>

<p>He swiftly put back the files. Perhaps he had
already remained too long.</p>

<p>“Countess,” he whispered, “I am going to leave
the house immediately.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to suggest it,” she returned.
“It would be dangerous for you here. The prince
has a violent temper; if he found out he might stop
at nothing. And I shall go with you.”</p>

<p>“Go with me?”</p>

<p>“I have led you into this. Do you think I shall
desert you?”</p>

<p>“But countess——”</p>

<p>“Don’t protest. Besides, I can help you.” Her
brain had worked as rapidly as her hands, and she
had a plan in readiness. “I had this same idea for
finding out about Borodin before I came here. So I
prepared for my escape. I have bribed one of the
servants. He is to have a horse and sleigh ready
at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>“No, no, countess. I can’t let you run into this
danger!”</p>

<p>“Not when I am the cause of the danger?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I cannot! But I must go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>He started across the room. She followed him.</p>

<p>“But how will you escape?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say that I’ve been suddenly called away,
and ask for a sleigh to the station,” he said as they
entered the library. “I’ll be far away before
they——”</p>

<p>He broke off. The countess gave a counterfeit
cry of dismay. Before them stood the figure of
Prince Berloff. The pale mask of cultured gentlemanliness
was down, and all his relentless cruelty
glared at Drexel in a scowl of dark, malignant passion.</p>

<p>“What were you doing in my papers?” his voice
grated out.</p>

<p>Perhaps the prince had seen nothing, was merely
suspicious. “What papers?” Drexel asked, with
an effort at surprise.</p>

<p>“You cannot pretend innocence! I came in here
a minute ago—heard whispers—looked in and
saw you in my private papers.”</p>

<p>Drexel, feeling there remained for him but the
slenderest chance, did not see wherein that chance
would be bettered by a mild demeanour. Besides,
the mere sight of the man set his soul afire with wrath
and hatred.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose I was? What then?” he coolly
demanded.</p>

<p>“What were you looking for? What did you
find out?”</p>

<p>Drexel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Speak out! What were you looking for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“I do not choose to tell,” returned Drexel calmly.</p>

<p>“You do not choose to tell—eh?” repeated the
prince. “I think you do!” And he drew a pistol
and pointed it at Drexel’s breast.</p>

<p>The countess saw that the prince’s rage sprang
from his fear—his ever-present fear—that Drexel
had discovered him to be the chief of the hated secret
police. Also, she saw the danger of the prince
ruining her new-made scheme. She threw herself
between the two.</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, prince!” she cried. “It was all
my doing!”</p>

<p>He turned upon her fiercely. “Your doing?”</p>

<p>She put all the double meaning into her words that
she dared.</p>

<p>“I led him into it! The blame is all mine! He
merely did what I——”</p>

<p>“Stop, countess!” Drexel interposed. He looked
at the prince with the flaming recklessness of a mastering
hate. “The blame is not hers, Prince Berloff.
It is all mine. So whatever you do, you must
do to me alone. I might as well tell you, though,
in order to save your time, that I am not in the
least afraid of that pistol.”</p>

<p>The prince was silent a moment, during which he
held the pistol to Drexel’s breast and glared into
his defiant eyes. “Not afraid? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you dare not shoot.”</p>

<p>“You think not?”</p>

<p>“I know not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Berloff again was silent for a moment. “Why
do I not dare shoot?”</p>

<p>“Because you want to marry my cousin.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you were to shoot me down, no matter
under what circumstances, my cousin would never
marry you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the loss of your cousin will hold
me back?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear prince. But the loss of my cousin’s
millions will.”</p>

<p>The prince did not answer.</p>

<p>As he gazed at the prince, Drexel flamed with the
desire to hurl defiance, contempt, into that gleaming,
passion-worked face: to tell him that he knew
him for a man-hunter with the blood of rare-souled
thousands upon his hands, and that he was going
to disclose his perfidious business to his cousin Alice,
and proclaim it broadcast to the world. He was
almost overmastered by the impulse, let come what
might, to grapple that false throat and hold it till life
was gone.</p>

<p>But there was the promise of silence that he had
made to Sonya. His first consideration had to be
her safety, and her safety depended upon his own.
He thought of Captain Nadson; the captain might
enter at any moment, and bring about the undoing
of them both. For Sonya’s sake he must make
some desperate effort to escape.</p>

<p>He sought to get out of the room by virtue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
mere audacity. “And so, prince, since you are
afraid to use that weapon, you will have to think
of something else,” he said. “And that you may
think the better, I shall leave you to yourself.”</p>

<p>He pushed the pistol to one side and stepped
toward the door.</p>

<p>The fear that his secret was out dominated the
prince. “Stop, or I shoot!” he cried.</p>

<p>At the same instant, drawing nearer in the corridor,
sounded the deep voice of Captain Nadson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE FLIGHT WITH THE COUNTESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR an instant Drexel stood appalled. Then
the captain’s step sounded just without
the threshold—two more steps and all
was lost.</p>

<p>Drexel’s desperate eyes fell upon the electric-light
key beside the doorway. He sprang swiftly forward,
and the room was filled with blackness. He disliked
leaving the countess to face the trouble alone,
but his first duty was to Sonya. He made for the
door, and his shoulder brushed the captain’s.
“Excuse me,” he said, and was gone.</p>

<p>Berloff started to rush after him, but the countess,
who had caught his pistol, now caught his arm.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she whispered. “I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>He turned on the light and gave her a quick, penetrating
look. Then he wheeled upon Captain
Nadson, which well-disciplined officer was seeing
nothing he was not supposed to see.</p>

<p>“Captain, wait a moment in the study.”</p>

<p>The captain bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>“Quick!” breathed the countess. “Order me a
sleigh!”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Order first. Then I’ll explain. A sleigh with
one horse—and not too fast—and no driver.”</p>

<p>The prince took up the telephone from his desk
and gave the order.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me.”</p>

<p>“He has fallen right into my trap!” the countess
whispered. “He has found out where Borodin is—but
no more.”</p>

<p>“Then he does not guess——”</p>

<p>“No. I quizzed him about you,” she went on
rapidly. “He thinks you are only what you pretend
to be. Here’s my plan. He’s going to fly at
once with his information. I am going to take him
with me in the sleigh. We’re confederates, you
know. You discover that some papers have been
stolen—by whom, you have no idea. You have
the robbers pursued. We shall go toward the railroad
station. You must give orders that I am not
to be hurt. As for him——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall give the right orders for him!” said
the prince grimly. “And when we discover who
the dead man is I shall be properly horrified at the
terrible mistake. But they will all see it was the
fault of his own rashness.”</p>

<p>He opened a drawer of his desk and drew out a
couple of Government documents. “Take these.
It will help if they are found upon him.”</p>

<p>She took them. “You have men to pursue us?”</p>

<p>“A company of Cossacks is stationed in the village.
I’ll telephone for a squad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“You will hush up my part in this affair?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye, prince. I’ll claim my fifty
thousand to-night”—and with an excited, triumphant
smile she hurried out to find Drexel.</p>

<p>Drexel had rushed from the room with the desire
to tell Sonya of his success before he began his
flight. In this he was aided by her watchfulness.
The party had all gone into the music room, but she,
wondering what had become of him, lingered near
the door. When she saw him emerge from the
corridor and make for the entry, she crossed to
meet him. Her composure was perfect.</p>

<p>“I just saw the captain go in there,” she whispered.
“Didn’t he——”</p>

<p>“He didn’t see me,” Drexel returned quickly.
“I’ll explain some other time. Borodin is in the
Fortress of Peter and Paul.”</p>

<p>Her eyes glowed into his.</p>

<p>“I must go at once,” he said. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Go to Ivan and Nicolai. Good-bye ... comrade!”
And she gave him a look that made him
tingle all through.</p>

<p>As her proud figure turned coldly away, he slipped
out into the entry hall. But his uncle had seen him,
and before the old door-man had helped Drexel
into his fur coat Mr. Howard had joined him.</p>

<p>“Can I have a talk with you after you come in,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“No—I’m sorry,” Drexel answered rapidly, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to him every second had the worth of two lives.
“Just got a telephone message from St. Petersburg—got
to go back to Moscow on business—must
hurry to catch the train.” And disregarding his
uncle’s attempt at a reply Drexel rushed out.</p>

<p>Night was fully on, though the hour was scarcely
five. The sky was a-glitter with stars, all the wide
spaces of the night were flooded with the cold
brilliance of the moon, and this celestial brightness
was reflected and doubled by the vast mirror of the
snow. Why could not this have been a black and
hiding night? Drexel cursed this light as his
enemy.</p>

<p>He first struck out on foot; but it occurred to him
that if he walked the prince, were he minded to pursue,
could easily overtake him. So he turned and
made haste along the road that swept among the
hemlocks back to the stable, determined to ask
boldly for a sleigh.</p>

<p>As a curve in the avenue revealed the stable, a dark
object glided out and came toward him. It was the
answer to his unspoken prayer.</p>

<p>“For whom is this sleigh?” he asked the driver.</p>

<p>“Countess Baronova,” was the answer.</p>

<p>For the first time in these last tense minutes
he thought of the countess, and recalled her declaration
that she purposed escaping with him. But
before he could decide what should be his course
concerning her, he saw the countess herself hurrying
across the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“This is luck,” she gasped, “you are here already.”
She dismissed the driver. “Come, Mr. Drexel, we
must be off at once.”</p>

<p>“But, countess,” he objected, “I cannot let you
plunge into this danger!”</p>

<p>“I led you into it,” she replied, “and I am going
to share it.”</p>

<p>Again Drexel could not explain to her that another
had been his leader.</p>

<p>“I want to get away,” the countess continued, “to
help use the information you have gained. Besides,
I am in danger as well as you. I must fly, whether
I fly with you, or fly alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are determined,” said Drexel. He
helped her in and stepped in beside her.</p>

<p>He struck the horse into a gallop and the countess
tucked the thick bear robes snugly about them.
They sped silently over the snow, and a minute later
passed through the park gates.</p>

<p>“I feel safer now,” breathed the countess. She
drew something from her breast. “Here—take
these.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“Some documents I secured while we were searching
the prince’s study—papers of great value to us,
I think. They will be safer with you.”</p>

<p>Drexel thrust the papers into the pocket of his
shuba. “How did you get away from the prince?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a man came in, and then other people. The
prince could not make a scene before them, so I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
calmly walked out. I suppose he had no idea you
and I would run away.”</p>

<p>“Countess, I know you must think me very much
of a coward for my desertion of you. I—well,
I really can’t explain.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t apologize. You have shown you
were no coward. Besides, all has turned out for
the best. In an hour we’ll be at the station—two
hours after that in St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had a better horse,” said Drexel
ruefully. “This is a stiff old beast.”</p>

<p>“I dare say I didn’t bribe the stableman heavily
enough. But we shall make our train.”</p>

<p>They glided on—now over flat, bright spaces,
where the road seemed as broad as eye-reach—now
through shadowy forest stretches, where on
either side they could almost touch the pendant
boughs of the snowy evergreens. The countess
talked eagerly of their plans for the release of Borodin;
Drexel answered with reserve. She spoke
warmly of what it meant to her that she had won him
to the cause; on this subject, too, he was perforce
reticent.</p>

<p>Presently, after they had been riding for over
half an hour, Drexel thought he detected, penetrating
the countess’s unbroken talk, a faint, soft
thudding.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that?” he asked, looking back.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It sounds like horses’ feet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“I hear nothing; it must be imagination. See,
the road is empty.” And so it was, to where it
emerged from a forest but a quarter of a mile
behind.</p>

<p>The countess talked rapidly on—talk that was
as wax to fill his ears against that warning sound.
But soon the thudding had come so near that it
could no longer be concealed by the countess’s conversation.
Drexel looked back again. Forth from
the forest into the broad moonlight shot four dark
bodies, and sped swiftly toward them over the snow.</p>

<p>“Look, countess!” he cried. “We are pursued!”</p>

<p>“Yes—horsemen!” she breathed. “The prince
has sent for us.”</p>

<p>Drexel leaned forward and began to beat the
horse’s flanks with the ends of the lines; the whip
the countess had dropped out unnoticed when they
had climbed into the sleigh. But belabouring the
beast was to little purpose. The countess’s orders
had been well observed. The horse was one of
those dogged roadsters that can strike a fair gait at
daybreak and hold to it till nightfall, but that cannot
be pressed much beyond this speed, no matter how
strong the arm that lays on the whip. The animal
quivered at the blows, but kept his even pace.</p>

<p>“They’re gaining on us fast!” Drexel exclaimed.
“We can never outrun them with this beast of wood!”</p>

<p>The countess had to play her part. “What shall
we do?” she asked. Her voice came out with a
difficulty that surprised her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“What can we do in this great empty prairie?”
he returned grimly. “In fifteen or twenty minutes
they’ll be upon us.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see.”</p>

<p>They glided on—the excellent cob doing its
mediocre best, the four black figures gaining, gaining,
gaining—showing more and ever more clearly
the lines of horses and armed men. It was a race
that could have but one end. Soon the pursuers
were but three hundred yards behind; and still they
crept closer, closer. Drexel thought these horsemen
meant only arrest—which would be disaster
enough; he never guessed that death was riding after
him, and that in his pocket were papers that would
justify his killing.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards ... one hundred seventy-five.</p>

<p>In five more minutes it would all be over; the
countess’s fifty thousand rubles would be earned.
She stole a glance at the face of the man she had led
to his end in this white waste. In the moonlight
it showed clean-cut, strong.</p>

<p>“There is no escape?” she whispered—and
her voice sounded strange in her ears.</p>

<p>His head shook.</p>

<p>One hundred fifty yards ... one hundred twenty-five.</p>

<p>“Countess,” said Drexel, with intense self-reproach,
“I cannot tell you how I blame myself
for letting you come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Had I not come, I would have been in trouble
just the same,” she said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But even if so, far better be
arrested in Prince Berloff’s house, than by those
Cossacks in this desert spot.”</p>

<p>The countess, her head turned backwards, saw
Drexel’s death, her fortune, gain upon them—and no
chance of escape before him. He was as thoroughly
trapped in this vast, open country as though he
were locked in a narrow dungeon in the granite
heart of a prison-fortress.</p>

<p>At the moment the Cossacks had come galloping
out of the forest that peculiar emotional excitement
that had possessed the countess all day had suddenly
leaped to a thousandfold its former keenness. As the
Cossacks gained, the feeling had grown more intense.
She did not try to analyze that feeling; had she, she
would have thought it born of the thrill of the death-moment
riding so hard behind.</p>

<p>As the Cossacks sounded closer, closer, as her well-plotted
success drew nearer, nearer, she grew weak,
and her strange feeling swirled dizzily within her.
And still it had no meaning.</p>

<p>One hundred yards.</p>

<p>“Stop—or we fire!” boomed across the night in
a deep and powerful voice.</p>

<p>The moonlight, shining straight into the speaker’s
bearded face, corroborated the voice. Drexel saw
the leader was Captain Nadson.</p>

<p>And he was all but in that man’s hands. For an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
instant he thought what his capture would mean to
Sonya!</p>

<p>“Take the lines, countess,” he said sharply.
“Now crouch down in the body of the sleigh, so
there’ll be less danger of your being hit.” He himself
huddled on the floor, his face toward the Cossacks,
his Browning pistol drawn.</p>

<p>For a moment the countess—“the cleverest,
keenest, most heartless woman spy in Russia”—sat
crouching in the bottom of the sleigh, reeling,
appalled. The captain’s cry, “Stop, or we fire!”
was to her the beginning of the death climax, and
this nearness of the end revealed to her, as though
by a flash of lightning, the meaning of her
all-day’s strange excitement and of her present wild
emotion—and the revelation froze her soul with
horror.</p>

<p>This man that she had led to this lonely death,
she loved him!</p>

<p>She had, in the pursuit of her profession, lured
many a man to acts or confidences that had sent
him to prison, to frozen exile on far Siberian plains,
even to death by bullet or hangman’s noose. For
more than one of these victims she had felt a liking—which,
however, had never stayed her purpose;
and when the man was gone, and his price was in
her hand, she had never wished her act undone.
Her original liking for Drexel she had lightly classified
as one with these others—and only this climacteric
moment revealed the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>She loved him—she had set this trap for him—and
now she was powerless to save him!</p>

<p>She sprang up and began wildly to belabour the
horse. The poor beast, under this terrific beating,
did manage to make a little spurt and for a moment
they held their own.</p>

<p>“You are under arrest! Stop—or we fire!”
bellowed the captain.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could shoot them?” gasped
the countess over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have only the seven cartridges in my pistol.
And I’m a poor shot.”</p>

<p>“Try! Try!”</p>

<p>“If I fire, all four of them will fire. They have
carbines. If they begin to shoot it may mean that
you’ll be killed. It’s better for you to be arrested.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of me!” she cried frantically.
“I’d rather be killed. Shoot! Shoot!”</p>

<p>“Wait till they are nearer. My pistol will have
a better chance.”</p>

<p>The next moment there was a spurt of fire. He
looked behind him to see if the countess had been
hit, and for the first time saw that she was on her
feet striking the horse with all her strength.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” he cried, and he seized the back of
her coat and dragged her into the bottom of the
sleigh beside him.</p>

<p>“Then shoot!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“If I could only kill the captain I wouldn’t mind
arrest so much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“You must kill them all! All!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because they——”</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly. She dared not tell him
why. To tell him that they meant to kill him,
would be to reveal to him that they were but the
tools working out her design.</p>

<p>“You must kill them all! All!” she repeated
frantically.</p>

<p>Another flash—another whizzing bullet.</p>

<p>“Here goes, then. For the captain first.”</p>

<p>His Browning flamed out. The captain and the
other three galloped on. The Browning cracked
again—and a third time. All four riders still
kept their seats.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” moaned the countess. “Only four
bullets left! You <i>can’t</i> miss again. You must get
a man with every bullet!”</p>

<p>“Stop!” roared the captain. “We don’t want to
shoot. We don’t want to hurt the woman!”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” gasped the countess to Drexel. “And
for God’s sake shoot straight!”</p>

<p>Drexel in silence tried to take careful aim over
the back of the sleigh. But a galloping horseman
at forty yards is not an easy moonlight pistol target
for a novice in a swaying sleigh. After the crack
of the pistol the captain rode on, but one of the men
slowly fell behind.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” breathed the countess. “You’ve
wounded a horse. Once more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>At the next shot the captain’s bridle arm fell to his
side. The sixth went wide.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” groaned the countess.</p>

<p>“They’re not shooting any better,” commented
Drexel between his teeth.</p>

<p>She could not explain that their shots were going
wild because they were under orders not to risk
injuring her.</p>

<p>“Is the next the only cartridge? Feel in your
pockets—perhaps you have some more!” she
implored.</p>

<p>“This is the last,” said he.</p>

<p>He took aim at the captain—fired—threw the
empty Browning away with a cry of despair. For
the captain still sat his saddle.</p>

<p>“All is over,” he said grimly.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she cried. “They must not take you!
They must not!”</p>

<p>“I’m willing they should not.”</p>

<p>“See—we’re in the forest,” she said desperately.
“We’re running within two or three paces of the
trees. See how thick they are. The men could
never follow you on horseback in there. If you
jump from the sleigh and make a dash——”</p>

<p>“I shall not desert you, countess,” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“You must—you must! They’ll take me just
the same whether you go or remain. So why should
not you at least escape?”</p>

<p>Yes, his thought told him in a flash, it would be
just the same with the countess. That being the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
he should think of Sonya—think of his safety, which
was Sonya’s safety.</p>

<p>“I’ll pretend to help them,” she went on breathlessly.
“I’ll try to hold you; we’ll pretend to have
a struggle—that’ll make them more lenient with
me.” This bit of play-acting was an inspired device
for clearing herself with Prince Berloff. “And if
you get away, don’t go near a railway station; the
prince will have men waiting for you at them all.
Now!”</p>

<p>She seized him and turned backward toward the
pursuers. “Hurry!—Hurry!” she cried to them.
“I have him!” And to Drexel she whispered: “Now
struggle to break away from me. Be rough—it
will be better for me if I have some marks to show.”</p>

<p>They struggled—squirmed and swayed about
in the rocking little vehicle—the countess encouraged
by the pursuers; and in the struggle she deftly
removed from his pocket the documents that were to
excuse his death.</p>

<p>“Now jump!” she whispered.</p>

<p>He leaped forth. Then, all within the space of
an instant, he went rolling in the snow—there were
four cracks—fine, dry snow-spray leaped up about
him—and at the instant’s end he was on his feet
and dashing into the forest.</p>

<p>Crack—crack—crack went the guns blindly
behind him, and the wild bullets whined among the
branches. The horsemen plunged in after him,
but were thrust back by the arms of the close-growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
wide-spreading trees. They sprang from their
horses and gave chase on foot. But Drexel, going at
the best speed he could make in the knee-deep snow,
weaving among the trees, stumbling often, scratching
his face on the undergrowth, heard their voices
grow fainter and fainter—and when he paused after
half an hour, completely blown, he could hear no
sound at all.</p>

<p>For the time, at least, he was safe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE MAN IN THE SHEEPSKIN COAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DREXEL sank down in the fine snow, his
back against a patriarch pine that rose
without a branch far up towards the stars;
and he sat there amid that vast white silence,
breathing heavily, and considering what he should
next do.</p>

<p>He had to get back to St. Petersburg, and soon,
else lose the prized chance of working on at Sonya’s
side. But he dared not make straight for the
railroad. The countess’s advice on that point
he knew was sound; those bullets which had grazed
him as he rolled in the snow were grim and indisputable
evidence that the pursuit of him was a most
serious matter. He thought of walking the fifty
miles, of riding in a relay of sleighs hired from peasants;
but he quickly realised that either method
offered little if any chance of escaping the hundreds
who would be sent out to scour the country for him,
and his mind returned to the railroad. After all,
he would go by train, and since he dared not go as
Henry Drexel, he would go in the one disguise the
country offered him. He would find a village,
secretly buy peasant clothing, and ride back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
to St. Petersburg under the very nose of spies and
police.</p>

<p>This settled, he found the North Star, calculated
the course he wished to follow through this unknown
country, and set out. Now that the spur of pursuit
was gone, he made but slow progress. Walking
is not easy in a huge fur coat through unbroken
snow a foot deep, and when your path is a series
of semi-circles round wide, earth-sweeping hemlocks,
and when every moment you have to set your course
anew by a star. At length, however, he came out
into the open. He was tired, but he kept on, heavily,
doggedly. He was beginning to fear that he might
walk on all night and find no village, having steered
an accurate course between them all, when he saw
in the distance a group of faint white mounds.</p>

<p>Soon he was at the head of the village street,
with its two lines of night-capped cottages. The
village lay in universal silence; not a window winked
with light. He determined to try the first cottage, and
toward this he instinctively went on tip-toe, lest some
slight noise should betray his presence to the village.</p>

<p>His precaution was in vain. Suddenly the yelp
of a dog broke upon the silence; then a relay of yelps
ran from the village’s one end to the other. One
lean dog, then another and another and another,
came leaping out at him, looking fiercely ravenous
in the ghostly moonlight. Drexel seized a stake
from the wicker-work fence of a barnyard, and kept
the white-fanged brutes at bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>But these dogs he feared less than another danger.
Momently he expected the village to rush out,
and thus ruin his plans of escape. But not a cottager
stirred. They had grown used to these canine
serenades; the barking no more disturbed their
rustic sleep than a street-car’s rattle does the city
dweller’s.</p>

<p>Keeping the snarling pack without the circle
of the swinging stake, Drexel knocked at the door—and
had to knock again and again before he heard a
stir. Finally there came a hesitant, “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“A friend! Let me in!” he called in a low tone.</p>

<p>He heard voices consulting. One said that
perhaps it was the police or soldiers, and if the door
was not opened they would burst it in or fire the
house. Whereupon the door swung open.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the voice of the tactician.</p>

<p>Drexel followed through a dark room, which a
sleepy rustling told him was inhabitated by hens,
into the peasants’ one living room—a room with
an earthen floor, walls of mud-plastered logs and
a ceiling that brushed the head. A well-built,
shaggy old man, and a younger man and woman,
evidently his son and daughter-in-law, received
Drexel. They were dressed practically as by day,
for the Russian peasant is too poor to possess many
bedclothes and he perforce sleeps in his day garments
for the sake of warmth.</p>

<p>“Will my lord sit down?” quaveringly asked the
old man, pulling forward a rough-hewn bench. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
were agitated by the strangeness of a richly-dressed
city man calling at their house at dead of night; and
they wavered between the peasant’s natural courtesy
and fear of some disaster this visit might portend.</p>

<p>Drexel’s exhausted body collapsed upon the rude
seat, and the three formed a staring semi-circle. His
eyes fixed upon the father as being nearest his size.</p>

<p>“I want you,” said he, “to sell me a suit of your
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Sell you this suit of clothes!” cried the old man.</p>

<p>“No, not that suit,” said Drexel wearily, eyeing
with disfavour the worn and greasy sheepskin coat.
“I want your other suit.”</p>

<p>“But this is the only suit I have.”</p>

<p>Drexel shuddered. “Then I guess I’ll have
to buy it. How much did it cost?”</p>

<p>“Ten rubles, my lord—when it was new.”</p>

<p>Drexel drew out his purse and laid down a note.
“There’s a hundred rubles.”</p>

<p>The three stared in an even greater amazement.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. “If I had so large
a note,” he said at length, “people would think I
stole it.”</p>

<p>Drexel took out several smaller bills that totalled
the same, and restored the first note to his purse.</p>

<p>The three hesitated—looked at one another—then
withdrew for a conference into the chickens’
apartment. When they returned, the old man said:</p>

<p>“Pardon, my lord—but if we do this, may we
not get into trouble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Isn’t it worth running a little risk to get twenty
times a thing’s value?” Drexel returned sharply.</p>

<p>They conferred again. “But if I sell this, what
shall I wear?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” groaned Drexel in exasperation.
“Can’t you take ten rubles of the hundred and buy
a new suit?”</p>

<p>“No—I dare not buy new clothes. All the
village knows we are very poor, knows we have hardly
a single ruble. If I get a new suit all the village
will ask questions and be suspicious. My lord
knows how the police look into everything; they
would take it up and make trouble.” He shook his
head. “No, I dare not sell.”</p>

<p>The old man was right about the new suit, Drexel
had to admit. His situation seemed hopeless.
But as they talked on a way opened, and finally
they settled upon a plan. Drexel was to have the
clothes—the old man was to remain in bed for a
day on pretense of illness—the son was to accompany
Drexel to St. Petersburg to bring back the
suit—and on the day after the morrow the father
could go about in his accustomed garb. Tired as
he was, Drexel had to laugh at all this complicated
caution to give him a few hours’ use of a suit hardly
worth its weight in rags.</p>

<p>The young woman delicately provided them
privacy by lying down on the broad low wooden
shelf that is the peasant’s only bed and turning her
face to the wall. A moment later the old man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
under a tattered blanket on the same bed, and his
clothes were on the earthen floor. Drexel, not
without some shrinking of the flesh, changed into the
old shirt of homespun linen, the tattered trousers,
and the greasy coat with the fleece turned inward.
Instead of boots or shoes there were slippers of
woven grass, and these the son tied on with cords,
having first swathed Drexel’s feet and calves in
rags. Drexel roughened his moustache, touselled
his hair and put on a fur cap which settled upon
his ears. He still did not look a typical village
peasant, but he counted on passing for a peasant
workingman who fluctuated between country and
city.</p>

<p>He offered his discarded garments as a gift to the
family for he dared not take them with him. But
the old man refused; such fine clothes would surely
get them into trouble. There was only one other
course. In one corner, filling a third of the room,
stood a great, clay-built oven. Drexel opened the
door of this, and into the fire went the dangerous
raiment.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Drexel and the young man
stepped out into the white, starry night; and after
following a beaten sleigh-track for an hour, and
when Drexel was feeling that his straw-shod feet
had turned to ice, they came at last to the station.</p>

<p>They entered the third-class waiting-room. A
broad passage ran through into the first- and second-class
room, and through this, with a show of stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
peasant curiosity, Drexel cautiously peeped. As
he had half expected, there stood Captain Nadson,
his left arm in a sling. He threw himself upon the
floor, among the other waiting passengers a-sprawl
in sleep, and drew his cap over his face. The
peasant dropped down beside him.</p>

<p>Presently the captain entered, saw the new figures,
crossed and kicked Drexel’s side.</p>

<p>“Wake up—you!” he called.</p>

<p>Drexel moved slightly. “What you want?” he
asked sleepily.</p>

<p>“Have you seen a man in a fine-looking coat
walking through the country?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen anybody,” said Drexel in a half
snore.</p>

<p>The captain kicked the guide, and Drexel, peering
from beneath his cap, saw the poor fellow was
trembling with terror—in a state of nerves to make
some catastrophic blunder.</p>

<p>To him the captain repeated his question.</p>

<p>“I—I—” began the peasant.</p>

<p>“We came here together,” put in Drexel. “Neither
of us saw anyone.”</p>

<p>The captain thrust his toe into Drexel’s side by
way of thanks, and walked out.</p>

<p>Soon the train arrived. Drexel, with his guide,
hurried out upon the platform, when to his
surprise and vast concern he saw come out of the
first-class waiting-room the imposing person of
General Valenko, and leaning upon him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
half supported by his arm, a well-wrapped, half-tottering
figure. He needed not the company of
the general to tell him who she was.</p>

<p>He was torn with keenest apprehension over
Sonya’s obvious illness. What was the cause of this
sudden seizure? Was it a distemper, prostrating
while it lasted, but harmless and swift to run its
course? Or did it promise to be dangerous and of
a long duration?—and was she hastening away
in this its incipient stage that she might have the
superior care of home and St. Petersburg?</p>

<p>And since she was ill, should he see her again?</p>

<p>The train started up. Drexel slipped aboard,
leaving the captain standing on the platform looking
for a fugitive dressed in clothes that were now ashes
in a peasant’s earthen stove.</p>

<p>A Russian train is a creature with a fine disdain
for speed, and a third-class coach makes each mile
seem five—but at length, toward morning, the
train drew into St. Petersburg. All the suffocating
journey Drexel had thought of little else but Sonya’s
weak figure swaying across the platform upon her
father’s arm; and when he got off the train, it was
to hasten to where stood the coach that he had seen
her enter. He saw her limp body carried out,
placed in a wheeled chair and pushed swiftly away.
He followed, and saw her lifted into a closed carriage,
and saw the horses tear away at full gallop. Of a
certainty, it was a serious illness indeed.</p>

<p>Drexel sat in the third-class waiting-room till a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
sullen dawn began to creep over the city. Having
arranged that his companion was to remain in the
station, his cap wrongside out upon his left knee
as a sign whereby a messenger might know him, he
started for the house where lived Ivan and Nicolai in
obedience to Sonya’s command. Weary as he was, he
dared not ride the long four miles; no peasant such
as he looked would spend forty kopeks for a sleigh.</p>

<p>The city was only beginning to rub sleep from its
eyes when he slipped unnoticed across the court to
the house he so well remembered, and rapped at
the door. Presently it opened a few inches and
he saw the boarding-house keeper.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said Drexel. “I want to see
Ivan and Nicolai.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got nothing for beggars. If you want
bread, here’s five kopeks. Now get away with you!”
He tried to close the door in Drexel’s face.</p>

<p>But Drexel’s shoulder went against the door.
“Hold on, friend. I’m not a beggar.”</p>

<p>“Either you or your clothes lie. Who are you
then?”</p>

<p>“A man who wishes humbly to apologize for
having done violence to your stomach four days ago.”
And he lifted his eclipsing cap.</p>

<p>The man stared. “Hey?—what’s that?” Then
with a sudden flash in his eyes he swung open the
door, and, when Drexel had entered, he swiftly
slammed it behind him and shot the bolt. “You’ll
not escape again!” he said grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“I don’t wish to,” Drexel lightly returned. But
it went through him with a chilling uneasiness that,
with Sonya sick, and no other to set him right with
the household, he would be prisoner here for so long
a time as they desired to hold him.</p>

<p>“I’ll announce myself,” Drexel continued and
went up the stairway. The outer door was unlocked,
and he crossed the empty room and knocked at the
second door. There was a sleepy cry of “Who’s
there?” to which Drexel responded by more
knocking, whereupon the door opened and revealed
the square figure of Ivan.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” snapped the little fellow.</p>

<p>“I want to come in, comrade,” cried Drexel,
doing so. “And I want food—sleep—clothes!”</p>

<p>The undershot jaw of Ivan fell loose. “The
American!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>He turned to the bed. “Look at him, Nicolai—in
those clothes! The American!”</p>

<p>Nicolai was already sitting up in bed, and there
was a revolver in his hand and it was pointing at
Drexel. “I see,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t a cordial way to say good-morning!
Put down that gun.”</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” returned Nicolai. “How do you
happen to be in those clothes? And how do you
come to be here?”</p>

<p>“Cheer me up with the sight of food and I’ll
talk. But first put away that gun. Oh, I had
forgotten the first formality guests are subjected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to in this establishment.” He held up his hands.
“Here, Ivan—get busy.”</p>

<p>The little fellow quickly searched him and
announced no weapons.</p>

<p>“Now breakfast,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>Still staring, Ivan brought the black bread and
bologna from the window-sill, and started the
samovar going. While the tea was being prepared,
and the breakfast being devoured, Drexel told them
as much as he thought wise of what had happened
in the three days since he had fled this room.</p>

<p>“And now I want some clothes. I dare not go
out in this dress and buy civilized garments. One
of you must do it for me.” He laid money on the
table and made a note of his sizes. “And now I’m
going to sleep.”</p>

<p>With that he stretched himself upon the couch,
the revolver of the wary Nicolai upon him. Not
again would they be caught off their guard and
tricked! For a time his mind was filled with painful
fears for Sonya; but his weariness was overpowering,
and soon he slipped off into deep slumber.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that scarce fifteen minutes had
passed when hushed voices from far, far above vaguely
penetrated his sleep. He seemed to float slowly up out
of bottomless depths to consciousness. One voice now
sounded like a woman’s voice. That a woman
should be here seemed curious. He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The next instant he was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Sonya!” he cried.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE WHITE ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE rose and crossed to him; and Ivan and
Nicolai slipped out. She was dressed as he
had seen her in this same room a week
before—in the coarse, quilted jacket and head-swathing
shawl of a factory girl.</p>

<p>Their hands gripped. He had never known
before what the grip of a hand could be. Nor how
glowing a pair of blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I thought you were sick!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Only a pretense,” she smiled.</p>

<p>He drew a breath of relief. “But even though
you are well, how did you manage to come here?”</p>

<p>“The time had come for me to stop being Princess
Valenko—so I just stopped.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. You have at length given up all that!”</p>

<p>“No—not yet.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you manage to leave home?—how
did you dare?”</p>

<p>They sat down together on the couch, peasant and
working-girl. Drexel now noticed that a lamp was
burning, and that without the window was blackness;
plainly he had slept the whole day.</p>

<p>“As soon as you told me last night where Borodin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
is,” she began, “I complained to my father about
feeling a fever coming on. I urged him to take me
home at once, so that I could have the proper attention
in case the fever developed seriously. I sent
for my own doctor; I said I would have no other.
He is a friend—a revolutionist. He found I had
a high fever; he ordered day and night nurses—also
revolutionists; he said that my condition was
so serious that no one should be allowed to see me—not
even my father.</p>

<p>“I waited till the way was made clear for me, then
in these clothes I slipped out through the servants’
entrance. Until further notice the nurses will
be keeping night and day watch upon Princess
Valenko; they will order special food for her; the
doctor will visit her two or three times a day, and
issue bulletins regarding her condition. And in the
meantime—here I am.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” laughed Drexel.</p>

<p>“Now about yourself,” she said. “That is vastly
more important.”</p>

<p>Drexel at first tried to give a mere bald outline,
but she impatiently demanded details of all that had
happened since she had saved the day by walking
forth to face the captain and the prince. So he
told everything; how he had found Borodin’s
whereabouts; how he had been trapped by the
prince, and almost by the captain; of his flight with
the countess and their pursuit; of his escape disguised
as a peasant. And if since yesterday he had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
through dangers, the look with which she regarded
him was payment a thousandfold.</p>

<p>“Forgive me for what I said in this room a week
ago,” she besought him.</p>

<p>“Forgive you?” he cried. “Why, it was I——”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she interrupted. “There is a side to
you I then no more than glimpsed. I now see that
it is really the larger side—perhaps it is really the
whole man. Since I then said unjust things, I
now want to say that you are generous, strong,
resourceful, brave, resolute, true.”</p>

<p>Her look might mean no more than warm and
grateful comradeship—and yet, his heart leaped
daringly. “I only hope that what you say is the
truth,” he stammered joyously.</p>

<p>“I do not know how much of a democrat you are—yet,”
she continued; “but you are the type of
man we need to help set Russia free. And that
makes me regret that we must lose you.”</p>

<p>“Lose me!”</p>

<p>“Yes. For you must now leave us.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Prince Berloff has discovered that you are
aiding us. He is after you—and not only for that,
but plainly for some private reason. The only
safe plan for you is to join your uncle’s family; he
dare not touch you then. Never leave them.”</p>

<p>“Never leave them? But I want to help
you!”</p>

<p>“Do you not see that he will have you watched?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
That if you come to us spies will follow you, and
discover us?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He thought a moment. “I see, then,
there is only one way.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would see it.”</p>

<p>“But not the way you mean. Not to go back.
But to stay among you. To live the underground
life. Won’t you let me?”</p>

<p>“But the danger!”</p>

<p>“Won’t you let me?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“You mean it?” The blue eyes shone with an
even brighter glow into the gray ones. “You do!
Ah—perhaps you will help set Russia free!”</p>

<p>It was on Drexel’s tongue to say it was not Russia—but
he remembered the scene of a week ago in
this room, and held back his words.</p>

<p>“Now that you have learned where my brother
is, we must begin the next step, to try to free him,”
she went on. “Our Central Committee is ready
to strike at once. We discuss plans to-night. I
go from here to The White One.”</p>

<p>“The White One!” exclaimed Drexel. “You
know The White One?”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“I have heard no name more often since I’ve been
in Russia. Might I ask what he is like?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me—I cannot tell even you. Only
the Central Committee and a very few others,
persons who have been tested by fire and water,
know who The White One is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>She paused, then said hesitant: “Possibly, after
all, you may see for yourself. I told about your
saving me and your offer to help us, and The White
One was very much interested. By what you have
done you have earned and proved the right to be
trusted, and when I tell all—who knows? At
any rate, I was going to ask you to walk there with
me.”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” said Drexel springing up.</p>

<p>“In those clothes?”</p>

<p>Drexel for the first moment since waking thought
of what he wore, and of him who waited for the
garments.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” he cried. And he told her
of leaving the peasant at the station twelve hours
before.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” she returned, “he is patiently
sitting there, his left leg over his right leg, his wrong-side-out
cap on his left knee. Ivan will take the
clothes to him. The outfit Ivan bought for you is
on the table. I will wait for you in the next room.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Drexel, in a cheap, ready-made
suit and overcoat, and with a forged passport describing
him as a mechanic, walked out of the court with
Sonya. He was now truly entering upon the underground
life; he was one of those who were being
hunted down craftily, ruthlessly by Prince Berloff’s
vast secret army; his life might any moment be
snuffed out. Yet he felt an intense exhilaration;
he felt that he and Sonya would defeat the prince,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
despite all his cunning, despite his myriads of
spies.</p>

<p>A furious wind was raging in from the Gulf of
Finland, armed with an icy snow that stabbed the
face like tiny daggers. As they bent away against it,
her arm through his, he asked her what had occurred
when the countess had been returned to Berloff’s
house the night before, but she had not seen the
countess. They spoke of Captain Nadson, against
whom in particular they must ever be on the watch;
and Sonya told him of the captain’s own company
of gendarmes, known as “Nadson’s Hundred,” who
had been recruited for the most merciless work
from the lowest and fiercest types of men.</p>

<p>As they came out upon the Palace Bridge they
paused, despite the gale, and gazed to where, a
few hundred yards up the Neva, stood the mighty
fortress-prison of Saints Peter and Paul. They
could not see it with their eyes, but they sensed
its fear-compelling form: a huge, low, irregular
oblong of massive granite walls, moat-surrounded,
washed on one side by the Neva’s flood, with cannon
scowling blackly forth. This grim pile was the
prison that held Borodin, perhaps in some dungeon
beneath the water’s level. And it was this grim
pile, separated from the Czar’s palace by only the
river’s width, in the centre of Russia’s troop-filled
capital—it was this that they two, a man and a
woman, with a few others proposed to rob of its
chief prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“That is a symbol of all Russia,” she murmured
with subdued passion. “Russia is just one great
jail; at best the position of the people is merely that
of prisoners on parole. The Czar is not a ruler.
He is merely head-jailer.”</p>

<p>They traversed the long bridge, went by the
Winter Palace, and turned south past the Cathedral
of St. Isaac. After walking a quarter of an hour
Sonya paused.</p>

<p>“We part here for the present. Go into that little
shop across the street, and spend ten minutes in
making some purchase. When you come out,
look at the windows on the third floor above the
door I enter. If the curtains are still down, you
are to return. If one is up a few inches, it will
mean that The White One desires to see you.”</p>

<p>Drexel watched her enter a door half a block
ahead, then he crossed to the shop and bought a
package of cheap tea. When he came out he
looked up at the windows. Light shone from
beneath one of the curtains.</p>

<p>He crossed eagerly, his pulses in a tumult—for
in a moment he was to stand face to face with this
famous mystery. His mind guessed wildly at what
figure he should find. Perhaps some great professor,
whose ethics or mathematics were only a mask for
this his real activity. Perhaps some noted general
from the Czar’s army. Perhaps even some mighty
nobleman, hiding his identity beneath this vague
and fearsome name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>He climbed the stairs and knocked. Sonya
admitted him and led him through a short hallway
into a plainly furnished room. Here were three
men, and a figure in a wheeled chair. Drexel swept
the three men with swift, tense wonder. Two were
the men he had seen with Sonya in the house in
Three Saints’ Court, the third he saw for the first
time. Which of the three was it?</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Drexel,” said Sonya. She took his
arm and led him forward. “And this is The White
One.”</p>

<p>It was to the wheeled chair that she led him.
Drexel looked at the chair and stood amazed. For
The White One, the leader feared and hated by the
Government, the master mind, the very heart of the
revolution, was a woman!</p>

<p>Aye, and an invalid at that! Her hands were
twisted, her body bent, and he had no guess of what
infirmities lay hid beneath the rug that warmed
her lower body. But disease had stayed its withering
hands at her shoulders. Such a head it had never
been his fortune to look upon before: a pale, deep-wrinkled
face, powerful, patient, austere, mighty
with purpose, yet in it a tremendous, lofty love;
and crowning her head, and falling unconfined upon
her shoulders, a mass of soft short hair as white as
the virgin snow.</p>

<p>The White One—well named indeed!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SONYA had taken her stand beside the
wheeled chair, her hand lightly upon
The White One’s shoulder. As Drexel
gazed upon the two women, side by side, and
gathered the significance of the pair, a tremor of awe
ran through all his being. Sisters in purpose, these
two generations: one who had given all, one ready to
give all. Sisters in purpose—yet what a contrast!
Sonya, fresh, young, lithely erect; the other pale,
old, shrivelled, twisted by a despot’s vengeful torture.</p>

<p>The White One bent upon him all-reading eyes,
deep-set in purple hollows; and Drexel had the
feeling that to her his soul was large print. After
a moment she held out to him a withered hand.
Though weak, its grasp was firm.</p>

<p>“We owe you much, Mr. Drexel,” she said, in a
firm, resonant voice. “We are grateful; but as yet
we can pay you in thanks alone.”</p>

<p>“That should be enough,” he managed to say.
“Yet I should also like something else.”</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“If I have helped, then to be allowed to help you
further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“So Sonya has told me.” Again those eyes
peered from their purple hollows into his soul.
“Pardon me if I seem to speak discourteously, but
you do not care much for the principles for which
we are struggling.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what my principles are,” he said
frankly. “I used to have opinions, definite ones—a
week ago. But now they are all unsettled and I
seem to be awhirl with new ones. But this I do
know: I am with you in this fight, and with you
with all my heart!”</p>

<p>The White One slowly nodded, “Yes, I know we
can trust you, and I know you are too useful a person
to be refused. You have shown both.”</p>

<p>She looked at the three men. “I say yes. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” they responded.</p>

<p>She again gave Drexel her withered hand. “Then
you shall help us,” said she.</p>

<p>Whereupon Sonya and the three men clasped
hands with him. He now learned the two men
he had before seen were Dr. Razoff, a distinguished
physician, and Pestel, a leader of the working-people.
The third was an official in the Ministry of the
Interior, which he had entered five years before for
the purpose of gaining advance knowledge of the
Government’s proposed action against the revolutionists.
His name was Sabatoff, and as one of his
functions was to secure and hold for use Government
blanks of all kinds, together with counterfeits of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
seals necessary to make them authoritative, he was
known as “The Keeper of the Seals.”</p>

<p>The Central Committee met here under the very
eyes of the police, but the police suspected nothing.
They knew this old woman well enough under her
true name of Madame Nikitin, for her long history
was written down in their records; but she was to
them a negligible person whose harm was long since
spent—little more than a corpse awaiting a delayed
sepulture. They knew that Dr. Razoff called frequently,
but he was her attending physician. They
knew of Sabatoff’s visits, but he was her man of
affairs. Pestel they knew only as an irregular servant
who came in to do the rough work in her apartment.
They never guessed that this little coterie,
seemingly summoned hither by routine business
relations, were the people that the police of all Russia
was exerting its every wile to discover and make
prisoners.</p>

<p>They all drew about The White One and began
to discuss what should be their plan to free Borodin
from the Fortress of Saints Peter and Paul. “First
we shall hear what Sonya has to propose,” said The
White One. “Since we have chosen her as leader
in this affair, and since Borodin is her brother, she
has given more thought to a plan than any of us.”</p>

<p>They all looked at Sonya and waited. “I have
a plan—yes,” she said. “But it is one I dislike,
one I would suggest only as a last resort. Let us
first discuss other possibilities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“How about your father?” suggested Sabatoff.
“As military governor he has absolute authority
over political prisoners. He loves you, I know; but
how about his son? If he were told who Borodin
is, would he do anything?”</p>

<p>She slowly shook her head. “It would be useless
to appeal to father in his behalf.”</p>

<p>“Then strategy is our only course,” Sabatoff
declared. “We must get some of our comrades
introduced into the Fortress as guards, and through
them manage his escape.”</p>

<p>“There is a bare chance that might succeed if we
had time for it,” returned Sonya. “But it would
take months. In the meantime the police may
any day discover Borodin is Borski, and discovery
will be followed by immediate execution. Whatever
we do we must do at once.”</p>

<p>“If we could only take the Fortress by force—blow
it up—wipe it off the earth!” growled Pestel.</p>

<p>All echoed that grim wish. But how achieve it?
Force might do for weaker prisons they all agreed,
but what force less than an uprisen nation could
subdue Peter and Paul? A Paris mob overthrew
the Bastille, yes—but the Bastille was a house of
cards compared to that granite citadel beside the
Neva.</p>

<p>“We will do that some day—never fear!” said
The White One. “But at present we must have
some other plan. What is yours, Sonya?”</p>

<p>All again turned their eyes upon Sonya. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
is very simple. To buy the coöperation of a prison
official.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The very highest—the governor of Peter and
Paul. I have heard that Governor Delwig has
fallen into disfavour and is soon to be displaced,
and is very bitter about it.” She looked at Sabatoff.
“Is that true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“You know him?”</p>

<p>“I have met him officially.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he could be bought?”</p>

<p>“Where is the Russian official who cannot—if
the price is right!”</p>

<p>They all agreed that Sonya’s suggestion was the
best and safest plan. Who should deal with the
governor of the Fortress was the next question. The
three men all volunteered for the delicate and dangerous
task, but Sonya insisted that the mission be
given her; of them all she was the one most concerned,
the one who would put most soul into it; and at
length she had her way.</p>

<p>But where should she arrange to see the governor?
If she were to appoint a rendezvous in any cafe, or
private house, or street, or even church, he might
fear some plot and remain away; or if he came, he
would contrive that they should be under the surveillance
of a secret guard, and it would be in his
power to seize her at any moment. Moreover, even
if he were agreeable to her proposal, they might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
be observed by some of the city’s omnipresent spies
and fatal suspicion be aroused.</p>

<p>Any plan she could devise that would succeed in
gaining her an audience with him required that she
should put herself in his power. Hence, what seemed
the boldest course was in reality the safest course,
and also was the simplest. On some pretense of
business she would call upon the governor in the
Fortress. If he accepted her proposal, she had
taken the course least likely to rouse outside suspicion.
If he rejected it, then, to be sure, she was caught
in that vast prison trap, but no more securely caught
than if seized in street or cafe by the governor’s
surveillant guard.</p>

<p>During all this talk The White One leaned back
and spoke but little, though she weighed every
suggestion. As she had said, Sonya was the leader
in this affair, and it was no part of her generalship
to reassume an authority that had been vested in a
deputy.</p>

<p>So much of the plan settled upon, nothing more
could be done till Delwig had been sounded. Sonya
and Drexel rose to depart, leaving The White One
and the three men to discuss other matters.</p>

<p>Once more the old woman stretched out to him
her wasted hand. “Good-night, Mr. Drexel. Do
not despair because we have given you nothing to
do. Before we are through you may have more
than you desire!”</p>

<p>He followed Sonya down into the street, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
still he saw that withered and blanched old figure in
the chair. All the time that he had sat watching
her, he had wondered who she was and what had
been her history; and now as he and Sonya, holding
to each other, went careening through the frenzied
wind, he asked her. The White One, said Sonya,
was the daughter of a scientist famous during the
third quarter of the last century, and herself had
been a learned and skilled physician. She had
become fired with the inspiration for freedom that
crept into Russia in the sixties, while she was in the
first flush of young womanhood, and ever since had
given heart and mind to the cause of liberty. Thirty-five
years she had spent in prison or Siberian exile.
Her last sentence had been to fifteen years of hard
labour in the Siberian mines. Here toil, exposure,
the bitter cold, the prison food, the vile living conditions,
a flogging she had been given, had at length
broken her once strong body. Two years before
she had been sent back on a stretcher as a “safe”
and negligible person—sent back to die. But her
thirty-five years of harsh captivity that had shattered
her body, had only strengthened her spirit. She
had returned to the struggle of right against might
with even greater devotion and intensity.</p>

<p>But she had to be careful, so very careful! Her life
hung but by a thread. Besides her paralysis, which
bound her prisoner to chair and bed, she had heart
trouble, and Dr. Razoff had said that any unusual
exertion, any high excitement, would be her end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>By the time Sonya had concluded they were back
again in Three Saints’ Court. As they entered the
outer of the upstairs rooms a man rose from the
table where he had been reading by the light of a
single candle. It was Freeman, the terrorist.</p>

<p>“I was told some of you would be back, so I
waited,” he said. “I have an idea——”</p>

<p>He recognized Drexel and broke off in surprise.
“Why it was to talk about you that I came here!
To plan for bringing you here in a day or two, as I had
promised. This is better than I had expected!
How does it happen you are here?”</p>

<p>Drexel remembered that Freeman was not one
of the few in the secret of Sonya’s identity—so he
dared not reveal the part she had played.</p>

<p>“I learned a secret from Prince Berloff’s papers,”
he answered easily. “I had to flee; you had told me
of this place; I came here.”</p>

<p>“It must have been a valuable discovery.” His
eyes suddenly flashed. “Not the whereabouts of
Borodin?” he said.</p>

<p>Drexel glanced at Sonya. He had gained the
information for her; it was for her to decide with
whom it should be shared.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said she.</p>

<p>Freeman seized Drexel’s hand. “Splendid!
Splendid! This is doing even more than I proposed
to you!”</p>

<p>His lean face glowed with a sinister light, and he
suggested, as one detail of their plan, that Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Berloff be “executed” and the “execution” be left
to him; but Sonya opposed that sanguinary course.
Whereupon he volunteered several suggestions bearing
upon their immediate plan of freeing Borodin;
and although Drexel felt an inward shrinking, he
had to acknowledge that Freeman was an adviser
of wonderful shrewdness, of endless expedient, of
intimate acquaintance with the conditions with which
their plan must deal. Drexel would have preferred
to work with an ally of less fearsome temperament,
but that he was an ally of supreme efficiency there
was no denying.</p>

<p>“You seemed to have some hesitation about Mr.
Freeman at that conference in this room a week
ago,” remarked Drexel, when the terrorist had gone.</p>

<p>“It is a peculiarity of our hunted underground
life that we hardly know whom to trust,” was Sonya’s
reply. “We are always suspecting one another.
And for the moment we were not certain about him.
He is too ruthless, he may be over-bold, but we can
hardly doubt his sincerity. You remember the
scene between him and Prince Berloff in the Hotel
Europe.”</p>

<p>“I was present,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“His course there was rash—but it proved that,
whatever his faults, he is sincere, and it brushed
away whatever suspicions may have risen in our
minds.”</p>

<p>Presently Sonya withdrew to the lower floor, where
she had a room in the quarters of the housekeeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and his wife, and Drexel went to bed in the adjoining
room. The next day Sonya was for going straight
to the governor, but she took the precaution to call
up the Fortress by telephone to learn whether he
was in. He was at the Ministry of the Interior for
the day, she was told, and had left word that he
could not be seen till the morrow. This postponement
of action was a heavy disappointment to her
but there was nothing for it but to wait.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the afternoon Sonya went
out with the housekeeper’s wife, and Drexel was left
to his thoughts. It was not long before the countess
came into his mind. Even though it had been for
the best, he felt a sharp, accusing shame over his
desertion of her, and he wondered what had befallen
her after he had leaped from the sleigh two nights
before.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that perhaps he could gain
some hint of her fate by applying to one of her
servants, and he went out to a public telephone and
called up her apartment house. To his surprise
the voice that answered was the countess’s. In
reply to his questions she said that if he would come
to her she would tell him all.</p>

<p>She was awaiting him in her drawing-room, pale
and rather worn, but no less richly handsome than
usual. She had, however, nothing of her rallying
good humour, her air of confident, luxurious grace.
She told him that she had fallen into the hands of
Captain Nadson and the Cossacks and had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
taken by the captain privately before Prince Berloff.
The prince had been most harsh with her, but to
save his guests the unpleasantness of being involved
in a scandal, he had decided to keep the matter
secret for the present. They had all returned to
St. Petersburg that day, except the prince; and
she, though apparently free, was under what
amounted to domiciliary arrest.</p>

<p>What had happened was of course a little
otherwise. When taken before Prince Berloff, she
had told the story of her failure, and how she had
struggled to prevent Drexel’s escape, and had been
corroborated by the captain and by the bruised
arms which she exhibited. The prince, bitterly
disappointed as he was, had to attribute the failure
to Drexel’s quickness of brain and body.</p>

<p>Drexel told her in turn how he had got back to
St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>“I know you have not returned to your hotel, for I
called it up,” said she. “Where have you gone?”</p>

<p>Her pallor deepened as he answered her.</p>

<p>“And so you are in the midst of a revolutionary
plot!” she breathed. “But how did you know of
that house?”</p>

<p>Once more he was forced to give her an evasive
reply. “Mr. Freeman told me of it.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him for several moments, and
appalling fear grew upon her. He was going right
forward with this plot she had lured him into—this
plot against his life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Suddenly she stretched out a jewelled hand and
caught his arm. “Please—please do not go back
to that house!” she cried.</p>

<p>He stared at her. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Please do not. I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“But why?” he asked. “Only two days ago
you urged me into this plan.”</p>

<p>“I did not then realize the danger!”</p>

<p>“I did. And I realize it now.”</p>

<p>But not all the danger, she wanted to cry out.
But to warn him of the whole of his danger would
be to reveal to him the truth about herself.</p>

<p>“And I am quite ready to face it,” he assured her.
“I shall see this affair through to the end.”</p>

<p>She turned ghastly white. If she spoke, he would
spurn her, despise her. If she did not——</p>

<p>But she dared not speak.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>FOR A BROTHER’S LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the coming on of dusk the next afternoon
Sonya set out for the Fortress. All was
staked on that one bold cast of the die—her
brother’s freedom if she won, her capture if she
lost. Drexel had besought her to let him be the
partner of her danger, but she had replied that for
him to come would be merely a useless risk, since
he could not possibly save her if trouble rose;
moreover, the governor certainly would not speak
in the presence of a third person. So she rode on
her errand alone.</p>

<p>She had the courage of her ancient race, but when
she drew up at the gate of that great gray pile she
could not keep down the pulsing fears. Such a
world of things hung upon the next few moments;
and here, before those high grim walls, how small
the chance of success became, how great and instant
seemed the dangers! The governor, perhaps thinking
to regain lost favour with the Government, might
hear her through and then virtuously reject the offer.
He would say a word, lift a hand, and she would
be caught in that giant trap.</p>

<p>To insure her admission she had sent ahead a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
note to Governor Delwig, stating that she was calling
to give him important information relative to one
of the prisoners. At the announcement of her
name (she had signed the note Madame Smirnova)
she was admitted to the Fortress and conducted
to a room opening into the governor’s office. But
she was not to see him at once; the governor esteemed
his life too dearly to let a stranger come straight
into his presence. A sentry made a search of her,
uncoiling even her thick black hair, peering even
into her mouth, to see that no compact explosive was
hidden there. This ceremony completed, word was
sent in to the governor that all was well; whereupon
an order came out for her admission.</p>

<p>Governor Delwig looked curtly up from a big
flat-topped desk as the door closed behind her.
But his manner changed at sight of his visitor.
Sonya knew what a powerful ally is good dress in
dealing with officials, and had attired herself accordingly.</p>

<p>He arose. “Madame Smirnova, I believe?”
he said, and with a bow he offered her a chair.</p>

<p>She sat down, and through her veil made a quick
study of the man upon whom her life now hung.
He was half bald, but amends were made by a
proud, wide-flaring beard, and a thick, upturned
moustache. His face was puffed with good feeding
and written over with the red script of a thousand
wine bottles—a face that could show hearty good
fellowship among friends, and that now regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Sonya with bland and deferential courtesy, but
behind which she saw a cruel, selfish, unprincipled
nature.</p>

<p>“I believe you have some information to give
regarding one of the prisoners,” he said. Near his
seemingly uncognizant right hand lay a pistol—silent
warning to visitors to make no suspicious move.</p>

<p>With an effort she got her dread and dislike of
this man under control. “Yes,” she said. “Regarding
the prisoner Borodin.”</p>

<p>His face took on a blank expression. “Borodin?
There is no such prisoner here, madame.”</p>

<p>“I am aware, Governor Delwig, that you are
under orders to pretend ignorance of him. But
I have definite knowledge that he is in the Fortress.”</p>

<p>Her positive tone, no less than her positive words,
had its effect upon him. He hesitated. “And what
did you wish to say?”</p>

<p>She knew that gradual approach to her purpose
would count for nothing here. “First, I desire to
say, governor, that I realise that in coming here I
have put my life in your hands.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said he, raising his heavy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“For I am a revolutionist.”</p>

<p>“What!” He sat up straight and reached for
the pistol.</p>

<p>“I have been searched, you know,” she quietly
reminded him.</p>

<p>He drew back his hand. “What is your business
here?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“I wish to free Borodin.”</p>

<p>He fairly gasped. “And you tell me that! And
here in Peter and Paul! You certainly are a bold
one!”</p>

<p>“We thought that you might help us.”</p>

<p>“Help you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We knew you were incensed at the
Government. We thought you might consider
casting in your future with us, and riding into
power when the revolution succeeds.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” he cried. “It will never succeed!”</p>

<p>“Had you seen fit to join us,” she continued
quickly, “the first business we thought to entrust to
you was the freeing of Borodin. We have a large
sum of money to be devoted to that purpose. That
sum we had decided to put into your hands to be
expended as you see fit.”</p>

<p>He did not speak. His fat lids narrowed and his
small eyes stared at her with piercing intentness.
She waited with stilled breath.</p>

<p>His face suddenly grew dark. “I see!” he
breathed between his closed teeth. “Well, madame,
your little scheme won’t work!”</p>

<p>Her heart went out of her.</p>

<p>His heavy face had grown malignantly inflamed.
“You, and those who sent you, are clever—very
clever! And you thought you could bribe
me, and get me involved in a plan to free
Borodin, eh?”</p>

<p>She could not deny it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“But I see straight through your plot against me!”</p>

<p>She caught her breath. “Plot against <i>you</i>?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Plot against me, madame. Oh, I see through
it! You are an agent of my enemies. You were to
trick me into this Borodin business; when I was
thoroughly involved, my enemies thought to expose
me, and use the case to complete my ruin. Did
you think to catch me by such an old trick?”</p>

<p>On his desk stood a bronze alarm bell. He
stretched out a hand to strike it.</p>

<p>She caught and stayed his arm. “Stop—what
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Ringing for a guard.” His little eyes gleamed
with vindictive triumph. “Perhaps I cannot reach
my enemies, but at least I shall make their agent
suffer! I shall have you punished for what you pretend
to be—a revolutionist.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken!” she cried. “I am a revolutionist!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” sneered he. “There have been too many
schemes laid against me, not to see through a simple
one like this!”</p>

<p>“But I am a revolutionist, I tell you!”</p>

<p>He sneered again and he reached a second time
to strike the belt.</p>

<p>Again she seized his arm. “Wait, wait!” she
cried desperately. “I can prove that I tell you the
truth!”</p>

<p>“Prove it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Yes, I can prove it! You have a description of
the woman charged with the attempted shooting
of Prince Berloff?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>She raised her veil. “Compare the two faces.”</p>

<p>He scrutinized the flushed countenance thus
revealed. “A—ah!” he breathed.</p>

<p>“Did I not speak the truth?” she cried.</p>

<p>“You did,” said he deliberately. “And you spoke
it also when you said you had put your life in my
hands.”</p>

<p>There was a new light in his little eyes—a gloating
light. It sent a shiver through her.</p>

<p>“There is a reward of ten thousand rubles for
your arrest. Madame”—he bowed to her—“I
thank you for those ten thousand rubles!”</p>

<p>His words, the gleam of his eyes, left no doubt
of his purpose. She steadied herself and looked at
him with calm eyes.</p>

<p>“But you are not going to arrest me,” she
said. “To let me go, to help free Borodin, will
mean much more to you than ten thousand rubles.”
She tossed a packet of notes upon the desk.</p>

<p>His face grew black again, and he did not even
glance at the notes. “You try to bribe me!”</p>

<p>“I suggest that you look at the money.”</p>

<p>But he held his menacing scowl upon her.</p>

<p>“There is fifteen thousand rubles there,” said she.
“And there will be five more, twenty thousand
rubles in all, when the work is completed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>His gaze grew even blacker. “What—you
dare insult me!”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five thousand.”</p>

<p>“I tell you my honour is not for sale!” And he
raised his hand above the bell.</p>

<p>“Thirty thousand,” said Sonya, “would be our
limit.”</p>

<p>The hand paused—then sank to his side. He
glowered at her, stormed at her—then at length
he said:</p>

<p>“Why, even if I were willing, it could not be
safely done!”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later she left the Fortress, the
agreement made, though the plan was but vaguely
formed. She drove swiftly home, bringing vast
relief to Drexel, and with him hurried off to The
White One’s where Dr. Razoff and Pestel were
already waiting in anticipation of the meeting.
Sabatoff was not present; his position in the Ministry
of the Interior was too valuable to the Committee
for him to endanger it by running any avoidable
risks. They discussed the plan for half the night,
and discussed it the next night, and the next; and
Sonya had further interviews with the governor to
perfect the Fortress arrangements. Sonya and
Drexel went over the plan with Freeman several
times in the house in Three Saints’ Court. Freeman
was full of keen, able suggestions and was of tireless
energy in arranging the details of Borodin’s flight.</p>

<p>Four days of consultation and work, and the plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
was complete. The governor had demanded its first
requisite to be that it should make him seem guiltless
of complicity in the escape. Among the prison
guards were two of his creatures of such dark records
that, should they turn against him, their word
would count for nothing. For a thousand rubles
each these two gladly undertook the roles of scapegoats.
At the hour set for the escape they were to
be the watch before Borodin’s cell; a guard’s uniform
was to be smuggled in to him; and, aided by a clever
disposition of the prison forces which would keep
all eyes off the cell for a few moments, he would be
whisked out at the time of the changing of the
guard and would march away as one of the relieved
watch, and so out of the Fortress. A sleigh
would be in readiness to carry him to the house in
Three Saints’ Court, where he would change his
guard’s clothing for a disguise, and from thence he
would immediately set out for the German frontier.
As for the two guards, they would straightway take
to flight and would be far over the Finnish border
before Governor Delwig made his discovery of the
escape.</p>

<p>The plan had dozens of details, and Sonya and
Drexel were ever on the move—always on their
guard to avoid a sudden meeting with Captain
Nadson. But though Drexel’s every hour was
filled his mind went more than once to his relatives
at the Hotel Europe, and he reached one definite
decision regarding Alice’s approaching marriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
The hour this escape was consummated (two days
before the day set for the wedding) he would return
to his hotel, share with uncle, aunt and cousin the
secret of Berloff’s position and character, and do
whatever else might be needed to save his cousin
from that arch-villain. In the meantime, to still any
possible uneasiness, he wrote a letter to his uncle
stating that he would be back from Moscow in time
for the wedding, and this he sent to a friend in
Moscow to be mailed.</p>

<p>These days made a deep impression on Drexel.
He was in constant contact and coöperation with men
and women whom he had to admire, yet whose ideals
were the exact opposite of those that had ruled his
life till two weeks before. Self-interest did not enter
into their thought; their ideas, their energies, their
very lives, were all directed to the interest of the
people. Living in the midst of this fire of devotion,
he felt for an instant now and then that a strange
new fire was being kindled in him; but in the tense
activity he did not analyze the impression made upon
him, indeed he was not wholly conscious of it. He
was stirred, he was busy—that was all.</p>

<p>Of another matter he was more conscious. His
love made him sensible to every change in Sonya’s
manner to him. She was engrossed with the plan
for her brother’s deliverance; yet little things, the
way she looked at him, the way she spoke to him,
made him daringly hope that her comradely feeling
might be turning to something more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>At length the darkness of the fifth evening settled
like a black sediment into Three Saints’ Court,
and found all in readiness. Sonya, Drexel and the
housekeeper were on duty in the house to receive
Borodin and aid his quick transformation; the
others were assigned to assist his flight hither
from the prison. On the table in Ivan’s room stood
a bottle of hair-dye, and beside it were a pair of
scissors and shaving utensils; across a chair lay a
new suit of clothes; at nine o’clock, the hour set,
a swift horse would wait in a side street. Thirty
minutes after the bearded, brown-haired prison
guard entered, a black-haired, smooth-chinned business
man would ride off to the railway station.</p>

<p>As the appointed hour drew on, Sonya and
Drexel hardly spoke. Sonya, tense, nervous, paced
to and fro; and Drexel, in almost equal suspense,
watched her pale strained face. How glad he would
be when Borodin had come and gone and her dangerous
task was ended, for though he had rejoiced in
this close comradeship, he loved her far too dearly
not to wish her safely out of this great and constant
peril.</p>

<p>The bells of Three Saints’ Church rang seven.
Two more hours, and all would be under way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE BATTLE IN THREE SAINTS’ COURT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS THE bells of the little church ceased tolling
seven Sonya paused a moment from her
pacing. “Just about now they’ll be slipping
his uniform into his cell,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Ah—I do hope that nothing will go wrong!”
she breathed.</p>

<p>She resumed her restless pacing, and again the
silence of suspense settled between them.</p>

<p>Presently they heard a knock below. Soon the
housekeeper entered and held out a letter to Drexel.</p>

<p>“A messenger just brought it,” he said.</p>

<p>The note was on heavy fashionable paper and
gave off an odour of violets. Drexel glanced it
through, and let out a low cry.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Sonya.</p>

<p>“Listen. ‘Come to me instantly. Do not fail.
It is a matter of life-and-death importance.’ The
note is from Countess Baronova.”</p>

<p>Sonya thought for a moment. “You must go,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Not till this affair is over,” he returned. “I
cannot leave you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“You must go. She would not have sent that
unless the matter was of truly great importance.
You can be back in an hour; Borodin will not be
here till nine.”</p>

<p>He yielded to her judgment, and half an hour
later he rang the bell of the countess’s apartment.
A maid ushered him into the drawing-room and told
him the countess would be in immediately. But
one minute passed—three—five—ten—and no
countess. His patience would wait no longer. He
opened the entrance door and rang the apartment
bell. The maid reappeared.</p>

<p>“Tell the countess that I will return later,” he said.</p>

<p>But on the instant a voice called out, “Wait,
Mr. Drexel,” and the countess came toward him
through the hall. She was strikingly dressed, as
always; but she was even more pale, more worn,
than when he had last seen her, and there was a
new agitation in her manner.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you came!” she said, in a voice that
trembled with relief.</p>

<p>“I could not have come had I thought there would
have been so much delay,” he returned rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“I have purposely delayed. I confess it.”</p>

<p>“Why?—after you desired to get me here in
haste?”</p>

<p>“To make certain of keeping you here as long as
possible. I have just discovered you are in great
danger.”</p>

<p>“Danger from what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“I know only in a vague way. In moving among
the officials I pick up hints of things; that is my
value as a revolutionist. From what I have heard— But
promise to tell no one you learned this from me.
It might ruin me among the officials and thus ruin
my worth to the cause.”</p>

<p>“I promise.”</p>

<p>“From what I have just heard, you and your
group are in danger of arrest.”</p>

<p>“Immediate arrest?” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“This evening. Within the hour.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, countess!” And seizing his cap
he sprang for the door.</p>

<p>But she caught his arm. “No! No! You must
not go!”</p>

<p>“But I must warn the others!”</p>

<p>“It’s too late! Even now the police may be there.
You can do nothing.”</p>

<p>His mind saw Sonya, alone, with gendarmes
pouring in upon her. “Let go!” he cried fiercely.
“Let go!”</p>

<p>He tore her hand from his arm, but she threw
her back against the door, panting, her dark eyes
flashing wildly.</p>

<p>“If you go, it’s to your certain death!” she
gasped. “Prince Berloff has arranged this. He
will see that you do not escape. He wants to kill
you.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“If you could be killed—by accident—with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
blame attaching to him—is there not some way in
which it would benefit him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, countess—you must let me pass!”</p>

<p>“It will be to your death!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But I must warn the others!”</p>

<p>“No! No! I will not let you!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You leave me no other way!” and seizing her
wrists he dragged her struggling from the door. He
shook off her hands that again sought to detain him,
and plunged down the stairway—leaving her
collapsed upon the floor, white, motionless, on her
face a stare of ghastly horror.</p>

<p>He leaped into his waiting sleigh and thrust a
five-ruble note into the driver’s hands. “Back—at
your best speed!” he cried—and though the
driver laid the end of his lines upon the flanks of
his galloping horse, Drexel constantly breathed,
“Faster! Faster!”</p>

<p>He imagined every disaster as befalling Sonya.
But when he had reëntered the little court, and
rushed up the stairway, and burst into the room, it
was to find Sonya still safely there—and not so
poorly defended as he had thought, for Freeman
was with her.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said breathlessly, “we must fly!
The police may be here any moment!”</p>

<p>Sonya went suddenly white. “Then they have
found out our plan?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. But we’re in instant danger of
arrest. Come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“What! Desert our plan?” demanded Freeman.
“Desert Borodin?”</p>

<p>“But how will our being arrested aid him?”</p>

<p>“I do not believe there is any danger,” returned
Freeman. His thin lips curled slightly with disdain.
“Somebody’s fear has got the better of his
nerve!”</p>

<p>“But I’ve had definite warning!”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>“I promised not to tell.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” The terrorist’s lean face wrinkled
contemptuously. “If there was such a warning,
its purpose was to frighten us and make our plan
fail. We are going to stay here!”</p>

<p>Drexel turned to Sonya. “Come, Sonya!” he
begged.</p>

<p>She wavered, but before she could answer the
housekeeper entered with a letter for her. She tore
it open.</p>

<p>“From Sabatoff,” she said. Then she gave a low
moan of despair. “We’ve failed!”</p>

<p>“What does it say?” asked Drexel.</p>

<p>“‘Plan discovered. White One and Razoff
arrested; Delwig seized. Escape!’”</p>

<p>“That means we have been sold to the Government!”
cried Freeman.</p>

<p>“Yes—one of our group must have turned
traitor!” cried Sonya.</p>

<p>The terrorist’s face grew dark. “And it’s plain
who the traitor is!” He whipped out his pistol and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
sprang toward Drexel. “Well—he’ll never betray
again!”</p>

<p>But Sonya threw herself before the black weapon.
“He is not the traitor!” she cried. “No more than
yourself!”</p>

<p>“He sold us to the police—that’s how he knows
in advance the police are after us. And he’s trying
to play innocence by warning us when it’s too late.”
Freeman’s eyes flashed vengeful fury. “Stand
aside!”</p>

<p>Sonya held her place. “I tell you he is innocent!”
she said with ringing voice. “If you kill him, it
will be plain murder!”</p>

<p>Her words had an effect, for he slowly lowered the
pistol. “Well, I apologise if I’m—”</p>

<p>But Drexel waited not for apology. “Come on!”
he cried; and seizing Sonya’s arm he made for the
stairway, and dashed down and out into the court,
with Freeman and the housekeeper following.
But here they suddenly paused. Entering the gateway,
the only exit from the high-walled court, they
saw a group of shadowy figures. They were too late.</p>

<p>“Shall we surrender?” asked Sonya.</p>

<p>“Not I!” said Freeman grimly, and drew his
pistol.</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Sonya.</p>

<p>She turned to Drexel. “I forgot. It would be
better for you if we surrendered. You’re an American—you’re
not so deeply involved as we—the
Government cannot be so hard on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“I’m in more danger from the gendarmes than
any of you,” he returned. “We’ll not surrender.”</p>

<p>“Then back to the house,” she said. “We can
hold it for a time. Our comrades may gather and
come to our rescue. If not—anything is better
than falling into the gendarmes’ hands.”</p>

<p>They rushed into the house, locked the door,
and waited on the lower floor for the attack. In the
minute of waiting Sonya’s mind went apprehensively
to Borodin.</p>

<p>“If the police have learned everything,” she
breathed to Drexel, “then they probably have
learned that Borodin is Borski. If they have”—there
was a sob in her throat—“oh, my poor
brother!”</p>

<p>Freeman started. “What! Is Borodin really
Borski?—the leader of the South Russian revolt?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“And your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed. “No wonder you have
dared everything to release him!”</p>

<p>Sonya sighed tremulously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may not go so bad with him,” said
Drexel, desiring to comfort her. “If they have
discovered all about him, his being Prince Valenko
may make his fate lighter.”</p>

<p>Freeman cut off her reply. “Is Borski then
Prince Valenko?” he exclaimed, astounded. “The
son of the military governor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>He did not wait for her answer. “Then you are
the famous Princess Valenko!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I am Princess Valenko,” she returned quietly.</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” he ejaculated. “But all St. Petersburg
thinks you are dangerously——”</p>

<p>The expression of his amazement was cut short.
The footsteps and low voices of the gendarmes
sounded without. The four, all with pistols drawn,
grimly waited the gendarmes’ action.</p>

<p>It came in a moment. A heavy fist pounded on
the door and a deep bass bellowed to them: “Open
the door! Surrender!”</p>

<p>Sonya caught Drexel’s arm. “Captain Nadson’s
voice!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If I’m captured he’ll recognise me, and I’ll have
to face that charge of trying to kill Prince Berloff,”
she said.</p>

<p>“You’re that woman?” cried Freeman—and
added fiercely in the same breath: “The person
who tried to do that to Prince Berloff will not be
taken while I’m alive!”</p>

<p>“The gendarmes with him must be Nadson’s
Hundred!” breathed Drexel.</p>

<p>He said it with something like a shiver. For
these men, as Sonya had told him, were thugs,
ex-convicts, and many indeed had been taken
directly from prison and forgiven their robbery
or murder on condition that they undertake this
service; and all were big, bold, merciless men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>The fist again pounded. “Open that door!”
roared the captain.</p>

<p>The four said not a word.</p>

<p>The next instant the door creaked and bent under
the impact of heavy shoulders. And in the same
instant Freeman’s pistol spat twice into the thin
panels. There was a sharp cry.</p>

<p>“Come—try it again!” taunted the terrorist.</p>

<p>There was again silence without. “They’re
planning some new attack,” said Sonya.</p>

<p>They were—and it came the next moment. In
the room on their right a window crashed. Freeman
flung open the door and saw a burly figure scrambling
through the broken sash. Again his pistol flashed.
The gendarme went sprawling on the floor and did
not move.</p>

<p>“Come on—more of you!” shouted Freeman in
savage joy.</p>

<p>None of the gendarmes accepted the challenge
to enter, but a bullet did and tore off half an ear.
The terrorist did not flinch; but as the pistol flashed
without, he fired at the flash. There was a cry of
pain.</p>

<p>He stepped to one side, out of range, but kept
his pistol levelled at the window. “One more!”
he called. With his lean, sardonic face, his lips
curling away from his white teeth, he looked half
devil.</p>

<p>Again there was silence without—this time a
longer silence. Then suddenly there was a crash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
at the door. A panel splintered out, and the end
of a heavy pole burst through. At the same moment
figures began to leap into the window on the right,
and there was a splintering of glass on the floor
above and a heavy thud against the window-sill.</p>

<p>“It’s on in earnest now!” said Freeman grimly,
and turned his pistol again at the window on the
right.</p>

<p>“Come on—we’ll hold the upper floor!” Sonya
cried to Drexel and sprang up the stairway.</p>

<p>They rushed into Ivan’s room, whence the crash
had come. The end of a ladder stuck through
the demolished window and scrambling up it was
a gendarme. Drexel fired; the man fell, and none
was so bold as to spring to his deadly place upon
the ladder.</p>

<p>The crashing at the downstairs door sounded
louder. They rushed back to the stairway. The
door was almost down.</p>

<p>“We can hold this floor but a moment longer!”
shouted Freeman.</p>

<p>“Come up here, then!” called Drexel. “The
stairway’s easier to defend!”</p>

<p>He sprang into a bedroom and dragged out a chest
of drawers, which he placed at the head of the stairs
as a barricade, and this Sonya reinforced with a
mattress which she dragged after him.</p>

<p>Crash! Crash! went the battering-ram.</p>

<p>“Come up!” shouted Drexel.</p>

<p>The landlord plunged up the stairway and over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the barricade. But Freeman crouched before the
door, like a panther ready for the spring.</p>

<p>Crash! The splintered door flew from its hinges.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing left but a dash for life!” Freeman
cried up to them, and the dare-devil sprang over
the door and straight out among the gendarmes.</p>

<p>“Don’t kill him—we want his secrets!” roared
the captain.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a whirlwind scuffle without,
which testified to the terrorist’s desperate
strength. But it quickly ceased. “Handcuff him!”
the captain ordered. “Now in after the others!”</p>

<p>The three crouched down and their pistols looked
blackly over the barricade. There was a wild rush
of gendarmes through the door and up the stairway.
The three pistols spoke as one. Two men fell.
But the gendarmes rushed on up, firing as they
came; their bullets thudded into the barricade and
the walls behind the defenders. Bang—bang—bang
went the three pistols. The gendarmes
faltered before the deadly fire, then fell back.</p>

<p>“Up after them!” roared the captain, himself
safely without, and poured on his men dynamic
curses and more dynamic threats.</p>

<p>Their evil faces gleaming, the gendarmes charged
again. The three met them with a rapid fire, the
pistols’ flame and smoke almost in the gendarmes’
faces. But they surged on up. Two fell dead
against the breastworks. A huge, ferocious fellow
following stepped upon their bodies and vaulted
the barricade. He died in mid air. But he had
given death for death, and fell upon the landlord’s
body.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>But Sonya and Drexel had not time to glance
at the dead. Bang—bang—bang went their
pistols; and before this fierce, protected fire the
gendarmes again turned and fled pell-mell from
the house.</p>

<p>The captain first cursed his men, then his voice
raged in through the open door: “We’ll have you
out of there in five minutes!” And to his men he
said: “When they come out, seize the woman and
kill the foreigner.”</p>

<p>He moved away. Several minutes passed. Sonya
and Drexel wondered what their assailants were
doing. Then a low crackling sound came to their
ears.</p>

<p>“They’ve fired the house!” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she.</p>

<p>“They have us now. It’s stay here and be roasted,
or march down into their arms.”</p>

<p>The former alternative seemed not many minutes
off. The air began to grow furnace-hot; smoke
oozed through the floor.</p>

<p>“Shall we go down and surrender?” asked Sonya.</p>

<p>“If we do, I’ll be dead the minute we step outside
the door. Did you hear Captain Nadson give
special orders to kill the foreigner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why especially kill you?”</p>

<p>“He is so ordered by his master, Prince Berloff.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
And Drexel repeated what the countess had told
him.</p>

<p>“And to think,” cried Sonya, “that it is I that
put you in the prince’s power—I that brought you
to this fate. Oh, if at least I could only save you!”</p>

<p>Her eyes sank in frantic thought, and she saw
the two dead bodies. She sprang up, rushed into
Ivan’s room, and then rushed back again.</p>

<p>“You shall not die here!” she cried excitedly.
“We have still a chance! Quick! On with that
gendarme’s coat and cap!”</p>

<p>“But what—”</p>

<p>“The gendarmes are away from that side of the
house. I’ll slip down the ladder—you come
after, and lead me away as your captive. In
the darkness it may succeed. At least it’s a
chance!”</p>

<p>Drexel threw away his pistol, tore the long coat
from off the limp gendarme, slipped it on instead
of his own and put on the dead man’s cap.</p>

<p>“I’m ready—come!” he cried, and made for
Ivan’s room.</p>

<p>She stopped him with a hand upon his arm.
“I deceived you. That chance is no chance at all.
The house is surrounded.”</p>

<p>“Surrounded!” He rushed into the next room
and to the window, she following him. “Yes!
But if you knew it, why suggest——”</p>

<p>“To get you into that uniform.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Your wits will tell you later. Promise me one
thing. If you promise, you will make me meet much
easier whatever is to happen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I promise.”</p>

<p>“You are not to leave this room for two minutes.
And now I’m going down.”</p>

<p>She held out both her hands to him, and the fiery
light that glowed in through the window showed
him a face calm, beautiful—in it a new look that
made him catch his breath. They gazed a moment
into each other’s eyes. Then she loosed her hands,
and before he knew what she intended she had
drawn down his head and had kissed him on his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Sonya!” he cried, “Sonya!” and he caught her
wildly to him, and for one heaven-scaling moment
all that lay on the yonder side of that moment was
forgotten.</p>

<p>She gently freed herself, for the flames had leaped
through the floor and were now springing toward
the ceiling. “I must go,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“And is this to be the end of it all?” he cried
in agony. “Only this one moment?”</p>

<p>“So it seems.” There were tears in her eyes,
and in the flame-light they gleamed like stars.</p>

<p>They moved into the next room and closed the
door, and crossed to the door that opened on the
stairway.</p>

<p>“And now a last good-bye,” she said.</p>

<p>“No!” he cried. “We shall go down together!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“You have promised,” she returned....
“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he whispered brokenly.</p>

<p>She bent again to his lips, then stepped out upon
the stair-landing. “I surrender!” her clear voice
called loudly, steadily. And Drexel, breaking his
promise so far as to watch her to the last through the
crack of the door, saw the captain appear, and saw
her slender, noble figure move calmly toward him
down the dead-strewn stairs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE SPY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS SONYA came to the foot of the stairs
Drexel saw Captain Nadson start. “God!”
he ejaculated joyously. “The woman that
tried to kill Berloff!”</p>

<p>He seized her shoulder roughly with his uninjured
hand. “I did not think we were going to
get that prize, too! Well, my lady, you’ll not escape
this time!”</p>

<p>Drexel flared with the desire to rush down and
throttle the burly beast. One minute more, and
he would be free of his promise to Sonya.</p>

<p>“Where is that foreigner?” continued the captain.
“Isn’t he coming out?”</p>

<p>“He is wounded,” said Sonya.</p>

<p>“Here—men!” he roared. “Up with you and
get him!”</p>

<p>As half a dozen of the gendarmes lunged in,
Drexel saw Sonya deftly knock over the hallway’s
single lamp. It went out as it fell, and the hall
was darkness, save for the faint light that the snow
caught from the lurid blaze and threw in at the
door. Drexel now had an inkling of what was in
Sonya’s mind: there was no chance for her, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
him there was a fighting chance, and that chance
she was striving to give him.</p>

<p>As the men rushed up the stairway, swearing as
they stumbled over dead comrades, Drexel flattened
himself against the wall. Though the fire roared
in the farther room, this room was black, and on
this blackness hung his chance. The men surged
through the door. With high-beating heart Drexel
stepped forth and mixed among them.</p>

<p>They did not note that they had been joined by
another man. They cursed the blackness and
sought their wounded prey by kicking about the
floor. None kicked more ruthlessly than Drexel.</p>

<p>“He’s not in here,” growled one of the men.</p>

<p>“Let him roast—that’s as good as killing,”
said another. “I’m not going to stay in here.
It’s too hot and smoky for me.”</p>

<p>“And for me,” growled Drexel, coughing. “I’m
going.”</p>

<p>He walked out and started down the stairs, the
other complainant at his heels. “One of you bring
up a lantern,” was shouted after them.</p>

<p>Drexel thought of the story that lantern would
reveal: the coatless gendarme and his own discarded
coat. “You do it,” he said to his fellow,
again coughing. “I’m choking.”</p>

<p>He hurried out into the open air. Ahead of him
he saw the captain, and he put his hand to his face
as though to shield it from the scorching heat.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Nadson demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Drexel coughed violently. “I can’t stand it,”
he gasped in a muffled voice.</p>

<p>“Well, my lady, why didn’t you bring your
smelling salts?” the captain demanded sarcastically,
and proceeded to swear at him for a weak-stomached
coward. Then he gave Drexel a violent
shove. “Get out of here, and join the guard about
the prisoners!”</p>

<p>Drexel hurried across the court and out the gateway.
By the curb stood two sleighs, in the front
one Freeman, handcuffed, in the rear one Sonya,
and about them stood a solid circle of gendarmes,
and beyond these was a silent, unarmed crowd
glowering helplessly on. Drexel trembled with a
fierce impulse to hurl himself upon the guard, but
reason told him that course would help Sonya none
at all, and would be the end of him, and the end of
any aid he might give her should he escape.</p>

<p>A roar from the blazing house informed him that
his trick had been discovered. He coughed. “I’m
going to get a drink,” he remarked to the guards,
and walked quickly to the nearest corner. Fortunately
the street was empty; such people as were
abroad were before the entrance of the court. He
held up the skirts of his long coat and sprang away
at his best speed. At the next corner he turned
again, and at the next he turned once more. Luckily
here stood a sleigh waiting a fare.</p>

<p>Into this he leaped. “Quick—I’m after an
escaped prisoner!” he cried to the driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>The man lashed his horse into a gallop, and at
Drexel’s direction they sped for the Neva, crossed
it, and entered the broad Nevsky Prospect, where
they were quickly lost among the hundreds of darting
sleighs. Here Drexel dismissed his sleigh, took
another and drove southward to near the Marianskia
Theatre. Here he again dismissed the sleigh, and
once more he took another and this time ordered
himself driven into the northeastern part of the
city.</p>

<p>He felt that for the time at least he was safe
against capture.</p>

<p>Now that the excitement of his escape was over,
his whole being was torn with the agony of Sonya’s
loss. He saw her march, calmly erect, down the
stairway to her arrest, saw her sitting handcuffed
in the sleigh; saw her, in his imagination, meeting
a dozen dreadful fates, and, whatsoever they were,
meeting them with the calm heroism of Joan of Arc
upon the pyre at Rouen. And into his agony shot
the breath-taking thought that she loved him, and
he lived again that one supreme moment when he
had held her in her arms.</p>

<p>And then he recalled the cry of Freeman that they
had been betrayed. But for this traitor, she would
now be free! But for him, their love might have
come to bliss!</p>

<p>He sprang suddenly aflame with wild rage against
this unknown Judas. Who could the traitor be?
The desire to know, the desire for vengeance, mastered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
him. He knew of but one person at liberty
with whom he might consult—Sabatoff; and he
hurried away to his house.</p>

<p>Drexel knew that Sabatoff, the better to maintain
his character of an orthodox official, the better to
keep suspicious eyes turned from him, had surrounded
himself with stupid servants who had an
inherited loyalty to the Czar. But he considered
that, fugitive though he was, his gendarme’s uniform
would pass him by these hirelings, and so the
event proved.</p>

<p>He found the Keeper of the Seals making a
pretense of examining some documents of his department;
whatever might happen, he had to play his
part. Sabatoff also believed that their plans had
been betrayed by some one of their number; only
through a traitor could the Government have learned
such exact details. The man could not be Delwig,
for he would hardly betray himself; nor Freeman,
nor Razoff, for they were under arrest—and one
by one Sabatoff counted off the others who had been
concerned in the plan. Unquestionably it had been
none of them. Yet a spy, a traitor, there certainly
had been.</p>

<p>Drexel had told Sabatoff in detail all the happenings
of the evening, and Sabatoff now thought
upon them for a long space. At length he looked
up.</p>

<p>“The lady who warned you,” he said slowly, “she
loves you, does she not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Drexel could not deny what he had plainly seen.
“But what has that to do with the matter?”</p>

<p>“Does it not explain why she warned you—and
you alone?”</p>

<p>Drexel sprang up as Sabatoff’s meaning broke
upon him. “You think she is a spy?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“But how did she learn our plans?” he cried.
“And how do you explain this?” And he told him
of his escape with the countess from Berloff’s.</p>

<p>“I cannot explain that. And I do not know
how she learned our plans. Yet I do know she
is a spy. She knew our plans, and also the plans
of the police; who but a spy could know both? It
is plain she wished the police to succeed in every
detail except the capture of you. If she were the
revolutionist she claims to be, instead of trying to
save you alone, why did she not give warning to you
all in that note she sent?”</p>

<p>“You are right! I never thought of that!”</p>

<p>He seized his cap and was gone. Not knowing
what he purposed doing, impelled by a blind, overmastering
desire to make the person suffer who had
brought on the night’s disaster, he sped away to the
countess. He hastened up to her apartment and
rang. She herself opened the door. Her face was
blanched and strained.</p>

<p>She started at the sight of him. “You! Thank
God, you are safe!” she cried—and there was a
world of relief in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>He walked in without a word.</p>

<p>“Tell me, how did you escape? No, no, not
now!” Breathlessly she pushed him toward the
door. “Go, go! It’s dangerous for you here.
Some one is coming—”</p>

<p>She now noticed his face, black with awful accusation.
She stepped back with widened eyes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh, you damnable spy!”</p>

<p>The life went out of her almost as though his
words had been a bullet into her heart. She stared
at him, silent, shrinking, stricken with consternation.</p>

<p>“I see you cannot deny it!”</p>

<p>“It’s—false,” came from her dry lips.</p>

<p>“You lie!”</p>

<p>“It’s false! It’s false!”</p>

<p>“Of course you deny it. A woman would not
hesitate at another lie, whose trade it is to make
friends and sell them to their death. God, what
shall I do to you? You woman Judas!”</p>

<p>It was less the fear of the fate she thought she
saw in his rageful face than the frantic desire to
escape this awful accusation from the man she loved,
that prompted her to cry out desperately: “It’s false!
You’ve been deceived! I’m innocent!”</p>

<p>“You lie, I say. Your guilt is all over your face!”
He thought of Sonya, Sonya inspired by the holy
desire to help her people out of their bitter suffering—betrayed!
His eyes blazed with a yet fiercer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
wrath. “I should kill you as ruthlessly as you kill
others.”</p>

<p>“I’m innocent! I’m innocent!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“And you have the effrontery to say that after
what you did to-night!”</p>

<p>“What I—what I—” A dazed look came
into her face. “What I did to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what you did to-night! Betrayed our
plan, sold it to the Government!”</p>

<p>“Is that your only accusation?”</p>

<p>“God—is it not enough!”</p>

<p>She gave a cry of relief. “I swear to you I’m
innocent,” she cried eagerly. “I swear to you I
had nothing to do with to-night’s affair, except to
warn you. I swear it!”</p>

<p>“Swear it—but I won’t believe you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not the spy who betrayed you!” she cried
frantically. “I’m not, I tell you! I’m not!”</p>

<p>His fierce, hard face was unchanged. “And I
tell you—you lie!”</p>

<p>There was a ring at the door. The reply to him
died upon her lips. Her face went ashen.</p>

<p>“Quick—quick!” she whispered. “It’s not
safe for you here!” She clutched his arm and
pointed to a door hung with portières of crimson
silk. “Go through the hall, and out the rear
entrance. No! Not that!” Her face lighted with
sudden desperate purpose. “Step behind the portières
there, and I will prove my innocence!”</p>

<p>“Prove? How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“I will show you the real spy! I will make him
tell you all!”</p>

<p>He looked at her darkly. “Is this just a trick
to escape, or—”</p>

<p>“S-s-sh! Not so loud!”</p>

<p>“Or is the real spy at the door?”</p>

<p>“The real spy is at the door.”</p>

<p>His face lit with a vengeful joy. “Then I stay
here!”</p>

<p>The door-bell rang again.</p>

<p>“No, no, no!” she implored, frantically. “You
do not understand your danger! It may be your
death!”</p>

<p>“It may be his!” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” She twisted her hands in agony.
“Are you armed?”</p>

<p>“I am not. But my hands are enough.”</p>

<p>“You must go!” she cried. “Don’t you see—to
stay may be your death! Please—please!”
And she tried to push him toward the curtains.</p>

<p>“I shall stay. Open the door,” he ordered grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?” Again
she wrung her hands. “Listen! It would be
foolish to meet him now. Wait, you can see him
again—when you are armed. Besides, will you
not give me a chance to prove my innocence? Don’t
you wish to know the truth? I will make him tell
everything—everything!”</p>

<p>He wavered. She saw it, and again tried to press
him out. “Go—please—please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>He looked at her darkly, suspiciously. “I still
half think this is only a trick to escape.”</p>

<p>“I will not try to escape, I swear! And how
can I escape, with you but a yard away?”</p>

<p>The door-bell rang once more.</p>

<p>“Go! Go! Go!” she breathed frantically,
and she pushed him half resisting into the hall and
pulled the curtains before him.</p>

<p>Drexel, watching through the parting of the
portières, saw her stand a moment, hand pressed
against her heart, striving to calm her heaving
bosom and subdue the working passion of her face.
Then she opened the door.</p>

<p>“Here I am, Zenia—safe,” said the visitor.</p>

<p>Drexel started at the familiar voice. Then into
the room came—Drexel almost let out a cry—the
terrorist, James Freeman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FREEMAN laid off his overcoat, and stood
before her with triumph and exultation
in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Well—it’s all over,” he whispered. “A success—a
tremendous success!”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>He glanced toward the portières behind which
Drexel stood. “You are alone? There are no
servants about?”</p>

<p>“I had sent them to bed before you telephoned
you were coming.”</p>

<p>“What’s that noise overhead?”</p>

<p>“The people who live up there are having a
party.”</p>

<p>He now noticed her pallor. “How white you
are, Zenia!”</p>

<p>“Am I? I suppose it’s the suspense of waiting
to hear how things came out.”</p>

<p>“I had to see Berloff first, you know, before I
could come to you.”</p>

<p>“You have seen him then?”</p>

<p>“No. I went to him to report, but he was not
in. I’m going back in an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>They sat down, the countess turning her chair
so that she faced the curtains, he with his back to
them.</p>

<p>“How did you manage to escape?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Captain Nadson saw to that.”</p>

<p>“But your being there at the time of the arrest
was an unnecessary risk, a very great risk.”</p>

<p>“It is by taking big risks that you win big prizes!
I thought that in the excitement of the moment
they might let something drop that would be of
great importance.”</p>

<p>“But the danger from the revolutionists. If
they had suspected—”</p>

<p>“I played my part so well they couldn’t suspect!
I killed three or four gendarmes myself. They’re
cheap. Berloff tells me to shoot a few to keep up
my reputation.”</p>

<p>He leaned toward her and his eyes glistened.
“I tell you, Zenia, the risk was worth while!”</p>

<p>“Then you learned something?”</p>

<p>“Did I? Listen. I learned that Borodin is
Borski, and that the young woman arrested with
me is the one who shot at Berloff. But that is not
the best!”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you what it is now; Prince Berloff
may wish it kept an absolute secret for a while.
But it is something he’ll be glad to know. And he
will pay well for it, too! It will be our fortune,
Zenia, or I miss my guess!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Only the countess’s self-control enabled her to
restrain a cry. For the curtains had parted, and
Drexel, very white, had stepped noiselessly out.</p>

<p>As it was she went suddenly pale. “What’s
the matter?” queried Freeman.</p>

<p>There was an outburst of merriment in the apartment
overhead. Drexel paused, considered, then
slipped noiselessly back.</p>

<p>She regained her composure. “Nothing—just
a thought,” she returned. “And how about Mr.
Drexel?”</p>

<p>“I failed there—temporarily,” Freeman continued.
“In the beginning, to make sure of him,
I accused him of being a traitor, and was on the
point of shooting him myself. But I happened to
think that if it got out that I had killed him, it
might queer me among the revolutionists and might
later make living in America uncomfortable.
Besides, I was sure Nadson would get him.”</p>

<p>“And Nadson did not?”</p>

<p>“He let him escape. I suppose Berloff will be
mad. Berloff had it all arranged that Drexel’s
death was not to leak out till after the marriage;
the Howards were to suppose he was merely detained
in the South.”</p>

<p>“And The White One, and the others?”</p>

<p>“All safe in Peter and Paul, as I telephoned
you. And as for Drexel, I’ll get him later—sure.
He doesn’t suspect me—we’re certain to meet
sometime soon—and then!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The countess led him on with questions, asked
for the sake of the man behind the portières. For
ten years, Drexel learned by fitting together fragments
of Freeman’s answers, Freeman had been a
Russian spy. Most of the time he had been in New
York, his duty there having been to pose as an
active sympathizer with political refugees, gain
their confidence, and forward to the Russian Government
information on which their comrades in
Russia could be discovered and arrested. His
cleverness had caused him to be brought to Russia
where he had been able to deliver into the Government’s
hands scores of leading men and women.
Even those of the revolutionists who opposed his
violent methods had no doubt of his sincerity, so
wonderfully daring was he, and so wonderfully
successful had been his terroristic plots. They
did not guess that the Government for its private
reasons desired to get rid of these officials whom
Freeman slew, and by secretly aiding Freeman’s
terrorism had not only achieved this immediate
purpose but had reinforced the position among the
revolutionists of its best spy.</p>

<p>That scene between Freeman and Prince Berloff
in the Hotel Europe had been merely a bit of pre-arranged
play-acting. The pair knew that the
Central Committee was aware of Berloff’s office,
and they feared that the Committee was beginning
to suspect Freeman of secret relations with the
prince; and this public display of hostility had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
been to throw dust into the eyes of incipient
suspicion.</p>

<p>Freeman spoke exultantly of the rewards that were
as good as in his hands. “Fifty thousand from the
Government for the arrest of The White One and
the others; another fifty at least from Berloff’s
own pocket for what I have to tell him; fifty for
Drexel, whom I’ll not let slip again. Zenia, never
before has a spy made such a haul as this!”</p>

<p>“Never before was there such a clever spy.”</p>

<p>“We’re a pair, you and I! This business won’t
last forever; but there are plenty of other things
in which wits and beauty count. When we’re
married, we’ll be a match for the world—my Zenia!”</p>

<p>“Let’s not speak of that now,” she said nervously.
She gave an apprehensive look at the curtains.</p>

<p>He caught the look. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she said, “nothing.”</p>

<p>He glanced about at the curtains, then turned
back.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll be a match for the world,” he went
on. “Ah, but you are a clever one, my dear! Only
once have you ever failed. And I don’t understand
yet how the other night out at Berloff’s you let
Drexel get away from you. But with us both upon
the case—”</p>

<p>She went suddenly white. “Let’s speak of other
things,” she broke in.</p>

<p>He caught a second nervous glance at the portières.
“Is there something wrong with those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
curtains?” he said, and he quickly rose and made
for them, his hand instinctively reaching for his
pistol.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Don’t!” she cried, and she sprang
forward to catch his arm.</p>

<p>But already he had parted the curtains. He saw
no one and passed on into the hall, and the curtains
closed behind him. Pallid, breathless, the countess
awaited the sudden uproar of the struggle.</p>

<p>But after a minute Freeman reappeared.</p>

<p>“There was no one?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No one. But what made you try to stop me
from going in?”</p>

<p>“Just nerves,” she said.</p>

<p>They sat down and Freeman had begun to run
on about the fortune that was almost theirs, when
there was a ring. The countess opened the door.
Into the room walked Drexel.</p>

<p>A baleful exultation leaped into Freeman’s dark
face. But his impulse to shoot Drexel was instantly
checked by the realization that the shot would bring
the merry-makers overhead trooping down as witnesses
to his deed.</p>

<p>“Why, hello!” he cried holding out his hand.
“How did you escape? I’m mighty glad to see
you!”</p>

<p>“And I to see you,” said Drexel quietly.</p>

<p>He avoided the outstretched hand by turning
to the countess. “I came to tell you of our disaster.
But Mr. Freeman must have told you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Yes,” she said. She was very white, and looked
with sickening dread from man to man.</p>

<p>“Then I will not stay. The police are after me,
and I must get into hiding.”</p>

<p>“Wait, I’ll go with you,” Freeman eagerly put
in. “I was just leaving, and I want to talk over
some plans for retrieving our loss.”</p>

<p>Drexel had counted on just this offer when he had
decided it would be safest not to try to take his vengeance
here. But he did not show his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Very well. Come on.”</p>

<p>Freeman slipped on his overcoat, and as he did
so he swiftly transferred his pistol to the overcoat’s
outer pocket. “I’m ready. Good-night,
countess.”</p>

<p>She knew that Freeman was armed, that Drexel
had but his bare hands. “Don’t go yet, Mr. Drexel,”
she said, trying to speak calmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. But I must,” he returned.</p>

<p>She laid a hand upon his arm. It seemed a casual
touch, but the fingers gripped him tensely, warningly,
with wild appeal.</p>

<p>“But I want to hear your story of the affair.
Please stay.”</p>

<p>“Do not think me rude, countess. But as Mr.
Freeman says, we have some things to talk over.
So good-night.”</p>

<p>She saw the changeless determination beneath
his apparent calm. There was nothing more that
she could say. He knew what he was walking into,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
and any further warning to him would be but a
warning to Freeman.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she breathed. And clinging to
a chair-back, her face ghastly, she watched the two
go out.</p>

<p>“I have a sleigh waiting below,” said Freeman
as they went down. “I wanted to be unobserved,
so I left the driver behind. We can ride about and
talk. Let’s go through the State Garden; there’ll
be no danger of our being overheard there.”</p>

<p>Drexel knew well why Freeman suggested that
lonely park, sure to be deserted at this midnight
hour. But he acquiesced, for it suited his own
purpose no less than Freeman’s.</p>

<p>They got into the little backless sleigh, Freeman
took the reins in his left hand and slipped his
ungloved right into his overcoat pocket. The
horse was of that big, black, powerful breed the rich
of Russia have developed for carriage service. At
Freeman’s word he sprang away at a swift trot,
and they sped along the broad Fontanka Canal,
Drexel listening to a clever fabrication of Freeman’s
escape. He kept the tail of his eye on Freeman’s
pocketed right hand, for he knew what that hand
clutched, and held himself in tense readiness for
that hand’s first swift, hostile move.</p>

<p>They entered the park—broad, white, with the
hush of midnight brooding upon it. Drexel’s eye
never left that right hand, which he knew would
now dart out at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>He preferred to choose the moment himself.
He slipped an arm behind Freeman’s back as if
to support himself.</p>

<p>“Freeman,” he said in the same quiet tone in
which he had thus far spoken, “there is one thing
that I know which I have not yet told you.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>His voice rang out with sudden fierceness. “That
you are the traitor who sold us out!” Instantly
he pinned Freeman’s arms to his sides in a tight
embrace, rendering helpless, as he thought, that
pistol hand. “And now you are going to pay for it!”</p>

<p>Freeman must have been startled, but he was
not the man to lose a second. He dropped the
reins, twisted his body like a snake in the powerful
grip that held him, bringing his right side toward
Drexel.</p>

<p>“Am I?” he cried with a sardonic laugh. And
without trying to draw out his hand, he fired through
the pocket.</p>

<p>The bullet missed, but at the shot the big black
snorted and sprang away at a frenzied gallop.
Drexel gave Freeman no chance for a second shot.
He loosed his embrace and seized Freeman’s right
wrist. The pistol came out and instantly the four
hands were struggling over it—Freeman’s to aim
it for but a moment, Drexel’s to wrench it free.</p>

<p>Drexel had known that the man was stronger
than he seemed, but he had not guessed that that
lean body possessed such steely strength as it now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
revealed. Each time he tried a twist or a trick,
Freeman matched it, and laughed tauntingly at
his failure. So, swaying about in the tiny sleigh,
each struggling for an instant’s possession of that
which meant the other’s death, they dashed past
snow-shrouded shrubbery, past statues done up in
straw to ward off the marble-chipping cold—out
of the park—down an incline and out upon the
frozen river. And still they struggled, and still the
big black galloped madly over the ice.</p>

<p>Drexel saw that his gaining the pistol was doubtful,
and he determined that at least Freeman should have
no advantage from it. As they struggled he cautiously
shifted his grip on the pistol till his forefinger
slipped into the trigger guard. As swiftly as his
finger could work, he six times pulled the trigger,
and six times harmless fire spurted toward the stars.
The seventh time he pulled there was only a sharp
click that announced the pistol to be empty.</p>

<p>Instantly he dropped the weapon and drove his
right fist into Freeman’s face. The blow unbalanced
Freeman; he went reeling backward from the sleigh,
dragging Drexel with him, and the horse dashed
away through the night.</p>

<p>Locked together, the two fell heavily upon the
ice and rolled over and over. In the same moment
that Drexel had struck Freeman with his right,
his left had darted out and clutched the spy’s black-bearded
throat; and now as they tumbled and
twisted about, his hand held on with savage, deathlustful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
grip, and his fist drove again and again into
the spy’s face. Freeman beat the wrist of the hand
at his throat between hammer-like fists, but the
hand only bit the deeper.</p>

<p>“You’ll never play Judas again!” Drexel gloatingly
gasped into the other’s face, which gleamed
defiantly back into his. Somehow he realized that
they lay fighting in the shadow of Saints Peter and
Paul, where this man had sent Sonya. He drove in
his fists more fiercely. Freeman’s struggles grew
weaker, yet he spoke not a word for mercy; whatever
he was, he knew how to die game. Then the
struggling ceased, and the body lay limp. Still
Drexel’s vengeance-mad fists drove home.</p>

<p>He had not noticed that, upon the shots, several
figures had started running from the banks across
the ice. So he was now startled when a rough
voice called out, “Stop! What are you doing?”
and when a hand fell upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>He rose from the motionless body, and saw that
he was surrounded by policemen. He was giving
himself up for lost, when the policeman, who had
spoken, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see you are a gendarme.”</p>

<p>Drexel caught at the chance. “Yes,” he panted.
“I had arrested him, and he tried to shoot me.
He’s a political.”</p>

<p>“An important one?”</p>

<p>A bold idea came to Drexel. “You heard of
Captain Nadson’s great arrest to-night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>They had; in fact they had all been ordered to
be on the watch for a man who had escaped from
Nadson—a foreigner.</p>

<p>“That’s the very man,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Was he indeed!” they exclaimed. One stooped
and put his ear to Freeman’s chest.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” asked Drexel.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>A mighty pang of regret went through him.</p>

<p>“He’ll likely come to in a few minutes,” added
the policeman.</p>

<p>Drexel thought quickly. If Freeman revived,
this would be no company for him. “Will you
take charge of him, and take him to headquarters?”
he asked. “I want to catch my horse.”</p>

<p>They were proud to lead to their chief this prize
prisoner. Tired as he was, Drexel set off at a swift
run in the direction taken by the big black. He
sped over the ice till he knew the night blotted him
out of the policemen’s vision, then he made for the
bank and doubled about in obscure streets.</p>

<p>Now that his fury was spent, the great agony of
his love swept into him; and obeying its direction,
he made his way among government buildings and
palaces, and came out again beside the river and
stood leaning upon its granite wall. Behind him
was the hushed mansion of the Valenkos. He
gazed up at the dim-lighted window where watch
was being kept over the sick princess—her for
whom all noble St. Petersburg was anxiously concerned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
If St. Petersburg only knew! Then he
cast his eye across the river to where, in the moonlight,
like some fearsome, man-consuming monster
of tradition, lay the long, low, black shape that
was the Fortress of Peter and Paul; wherein, for
close upon two hundred years, men and women
distasteful to the Czars had been tortured, murdered,
driven mad—wherein this night, in some
dark and soundless dungeon, lay the woman of his
love, awaiting on the morrow who knew what?</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>A VICE-CZAR DOES HIS DUTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS same evening Prince Berloff dined with
the Howards at their hotel. There were
a score of noble guests, the highest of the
new friends Berloff would bring to Alice, and the
dinner was as elaborate as Russia’s capital could
provide. In a way this was a farewell function given
by her parents in honour of Alice; on the day after
the morrow, in the gilded splendour of St. Isaac’s
Cathedral, she was to become the Princess Berloff.
The prince, in his dress uniform of a colonel of the
Czar’s guards, with his breast a-glitter with jewelled
orders, looked a bridegroom worth any millionaire’s
money; and Alice, flushed with excitement, given
a new dignity by the nearness of her ennoblement,
looked a bride well worth the payment of any
princely name.</p>

<p>Berloff knew what was due to happen, while
they sat at table, in the house over in Three Saints’
Court. But the expectation that, even while he
ate and chatted, he was being put in direct command
of the Howard fortune by Drexel’s death, did not
make a ripple upon the surface of his composure.
He asked Mr. Howard if any further word had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
been received from Drexel, and affected satisfaction
when told of a second letter giving reassurance that
Drexel would be back in time for the marriage.</p>

<p>Beneath that calm front blazed a desire to know
if all had gone as planned, but midnight had long
passed before he could with propriety quit the
company and hurry to his apartment. He found
Captain Nadson waiting in his study. The captain
told of the arrest of the famed White One, and
of the evening’s other successes.</p>

<p>“Yes—very good,” said the prince. “But the
foreigner?”</p>

<p>The captain hesitated. “He escaped.”</p>

<p>“Escaped!” The prince stood up, his face suddenly
dark. “How?”</p>

<p>As Nadson told him, his thin lips drew back from
his white teeth. “Fool—blockhead!” he cried.</p>

<p>“But, Your Excellency, I succeeded in all else—and
I have got the girl that shot at you,” protested
the abashed officer.</p>

<p>“You failed in the one thing I laid stress upon!”
was the cold and fierce retort.</p>

<p>It might have gone hard with Nadson then and
there, had not a servant knocked and entered with
a card. Berloff glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Wait without—I’ll settle with you later!” he
said ominously to the captain. He turned to the
servant. “Show him in.”</p>

<p>The big gendarme, thoroughly cowed, went out.
The next moment Freeman weakly entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The prince stared. And well he might, for there
was not a patch of white in Freeman’s face. It
was all purple and green, and so swollen that his
eyes were but two narrow slits.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Who did it?”</p>

<p>“Drexel,” Freeman coolly returned.</p>

<p>“Drexel! When? How? I thought he escaped.”</p>

<p>Freeman calmly sat down and related what has
already been told, adding that he had been taken
as a political prisoner to police headquarters, where
he had been recognized and released. The prince’s
lips parted in wrath again. He rose and stood
menacingly above the spy.</p>

<p>“This is twice you people have had him in one
night, and twice you have let him escape! Such
infernal blunderers!”</p>

<p>Freeman stood up and his pulpy, discoloured
face looked straight into the pale, high-bred one.</p>

<p>“Prince,” said he slowly, and the narrow slits
blazed, “do you think you can talk to me as you do
to your Russian officers?”</p>

<p>They gazed at each other for a silent moment.
“Pardon me—I lost my temper,” said the prince.</p>

<p>Freeman nodded and sat down.</p>

<p>“That Drexel must have the nerve of the devil!”
Berloff continued.</p>

<p>“He has,” was the calm response.</p>

<p>“And I suppose we shall not get another chance
at him.”</p>

<p>“Won’t we! I have twice the reason I had before—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
I’ll get him, sure! So don’t worry about his
escape. Besides, if I have lost you Drexel I have
brought you something even more important.”</p>

<p>“More important? What is it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk a little business first. I believe that
after his children, you are the next heir to Prince
Valenko?”</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you in good time. You are, are you not?”</p>

<p>“You know I am.”</p>

<p>“And I believe you would be quite willing to have
these intervening heirs disappear—permanently—provided
no blame attached to you?”</p>

<p>The prince’s eyes narrowed, and he tried to
read Freeman’s meaning in his face, but that was
too blurred a page.</p>

<p>“Suppose I say yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose, then, I can arrange to put it in your
power to remove them safely—hum—how much?”</p>

<p>There was a stealthy silence. “How much do
you want?”</p>

<p>“Fifty thousand.”</p>

<p>Again a silence. “Very well.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said Freeman, and his slits of eyes
glittered. “Then I have the pleasure to tell you
that the job is done.”</p>

<p>“Done?”</p>

<p>“Yes, done! Prince, I have made some great
discoveries to-night! First, do you know who Borodin
is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>The prince started. “Not the young Prince
Valenko?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes. And do you know who else he is? No?
He is Borski.”</p>

<p>“Borski! The leader of the South Russian revolt?”</p>

<p>“The same!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” slowly breathed the prince, and his eyes
glittered back at Freeman’s. “But you forget.
There still remains his sister, the Princess Olga.”</p>

<p>“You have been told that a young woman was
arrested to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That young woman is the sister.”</p>

<p>This was too much for even Berloff’s self-command.
His thin lips fell apart and he stared at
Freeman.</p>

<p>“She Princess Olga? You are mistaken. Princess
Olga lies dangerously ill at home.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” Freeman calmly returned,
“Princess Olga lies in a cell in Peter and Paul.”</p>

<p>“You are certain?”</p>

<p>“She told me who she was herself—and told
me before Drexel.”</p>

<p>“Drexel knows the princess. You may be right.”
He walked the floor in repressed excitement. “Yes—you
are right! And her pretended illness is
only a trick to hide her absence!”</p>

<p>He came to a pause. “But what charge can be
made against her? The jail-breaking plot? Shooting
gendarmes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“An attempt to assassinate Prince Berloff.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“She is that woman. She confessed it to me.”</p>

<p>“Captain Nadson was not mistaken then! But
do many know all this?”</p>

<p>“Only you and I, and two or three revolutionists
besides those under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Then between us two it must remain a secret.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But you must act quickly, or the
revolutionists may decide to reveal it.”</p>

<p>The prince paced up and down the room in deep
concentration, then he took up his telephone. After
long waiting he got the number he desired.</p>

<p>“Is this one of the servants?” he asked. “Yes?
Will you awaken General Valenko and tell him that
Prince Berloff is coming over to see him immediately
on a matter of the very gravest importance?”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver. “Mr. Freeman, I
want you and Captain Nadson to come with me to
Prince Valenko’s. I shall want your evidence.
I think you will know what to say and what not
to say.”</p>

<p>Freeman’s slits of eyes gleamed, for he fathomed
the prince’s plan. “Clever—devilishly clever!”
he commented beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Berloff and his two subordinates
were admitted to the Valenko palace by
a sleepy servant. Berloff was ushered into a
room richly furnished as an administrative office.
The military governor raised his tall and portly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
body from his chair. He wore a dressing-gown
of deep crimson, and what with his gray hair, his
thick gray beard, his stern dominant face, and
his military carriage, he was a rarely imposing figure
of a man.</p>

<p>He greeted Berloff with grumbling cordiality.
“What fool business is this, that pulls a man out
of his bed at this time of the night?”</p>

<p>“So important that I did not feel justified in waiting
till morning to refer it to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, sit down, and out with it.”</p>

<p>Both took chairs. “But first,” said Berloff
sympathetically, “how is the princess?”</p>

<p>The general’s face softened with concern, and
he sighed. Those who said that the harsh old despot
loved his daughter put the truth conservatively.</p>

<p>“The doctor tells me she is still in serious danger.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned the general. “He says she must
be spared any such excitement.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know all St. Petersburg is praying
for the best.”</p>

<p>“I know—I know.” He sighed again. “But
what’s the business?”</p>

<p>“Of course you have heard about the arrests
made this evening.”</p>

<p>“Of course. It was a tremendous coup—especially
the capture of The White One.”</p>

<p>“Some first-rate information has come to me in
connection with the arrests.” The prince watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
the old man’s face closely and subdued his voice
to a tone of mere official interest. “First, the young
woman who was arrested is the woman who tried
to shoot me two weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“The devil you say! How did you learn it?”</p>

<p>“She confessed to Freeman. You know he was
intimate with the group. Besides, Captain Nadson
recognized her. They are both here to offer their
evidence in person. Of course I am merely reporting
what they told me.”</p>

<p>“What is she like?” asked the general.</p>

<p>“You know when she attacked me I saw her only
in the dusk. She was then dressed as a lady. But
that probably was only a disguise. Freeman can
tell you about her.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why her case could not have
waited till morning.”</p>

<p>“Her case is not all. I have learned the identity
of Borodin.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“He is Borski.”</p>

<p>The general’s red figure sprang up. “What!
The leader of the South Russian revolt!”</p>

<p>“Yes. The revolutionists confessed it to Freeman.”</p>

<p>The general rang sharply. “Show in the two
men who are waiting,” he said to the servant.</p>

<p>A minute later Freeman and the captain entered.
The latter, having the least to say, was first examined.
He testified to the identity of the arrested girl and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
was dismissed. The general then turned to Freeman,
and Berloff slipped back in his chair, withdrawing
as it were from the affair.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Freeman,” the general began, “you
declare that this Borodin is in reality Borski?”</p>

<p>“So the revolutionists confided to me.”</p>

<p>“They trusted you?”</p>

<p>“They considered me as one of themselves, Your
Excellency.”</p>

<p>“Then of course their statement is beyond question.
Did they tell you anything else about him?
Who he is—what he has done?”</p>

<p>For an instant Prince Berloff held his breath.
But he had no reason, for Freeman did not falter.</p>

<p>“Nothing else, Your Excellency.”</p>

<p>“They told you enough!” the general said grimly.
“And now as to the woman. She told you she
tried to assassinate Prince Berloff?”</p>

<p>“She said she was the woman wanted for the
attack,” was the adroit response.</p>

<p>“And she took part in the plot to free Borski?”</p>

<p>“She was its leader.”</p>

<p>“Its leader! You did not tell me that, Berloff!”</p>

<p>“I was only summarizing what I had been told,”
was the quiet reply. “I of course know nothing
at first hand and can make no charges. The evidence
is all Nadson’s and Freeman’s.”</p>

<p>Berloff was playing his game with his utmost skill.
When it came out in time who these two prisoners
were, as it must, no blame could attach to him; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
had merely laid the case before the military governor,
as in duty bound, and had himself given no
evidence and taken no action.</p>

<p>“Who is this woman? What is she like?” the
general continued of Freeman.</p>

<p>“She calls herself Sonya Varanova,” was the
ready answer. “She is in the early twenties and is
rather good-looking. She belongs, by her appearance,
to the common classes—is, in fact, a working
woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what all these trouble-makers are—the
riff-raff of Russia!” the general wrathfully
exclaimed. “Do you know anything else about her?”</p>

<p>“Nothing material to the case, Your Excellency.”</p>

<p>A moment later Freeman was dismissed.</p>

<p>“My business is of course only to discover political
criminals,” Berloff began quickly but without the
appearance of haste. “It rests wholly with you,
as the possessor of absolute power in such cases,
to decide what action shall be taken upon the information
I lodge with you. But I did feel, when I
discovered these things, that here were cases that
you would consider should be immediately and
rigorously dealt with. The revolutionists are getting
bolder every day; this attempted jail-delivery is
but a single instance. We have struck consternation
into them by the way we foiled that plot. If right
on top of that we could deliver them another sudden
and severe blow, nothing else would do so much to
frighten them into quiet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“You are right!” agreed the general. “It has
long been my guiding principle that severe action
is the only check for revolution.”</p>

<p>“And instant action,” subtly suggested the prince.</p>

<p>“And instant!” repeated the general.</p>

<p>There was little need, however, for the suggestion
to this old Vice-Czar, long accustomed to the relentless
exercise of autocratic power. He had sent
scores to instant death, without giving them trial,
without seeing them, upon far slighter charges
than those now laid before him. While in command
against the South Russian revolt it had been his
standing order that any person found with a pistol
upon him should be straightway stood against a
wall and shot. So now he did not hesitate.</p>

<p>He rang. “Tell my secretary to dress and come
here,” he ordered the servant. Then he sat down
at his desk, drew out two awesome documents and
began to fill in the first. While the general’s head
was down the prince did not try to hide his excitement;
his eyes glittered, and his breath came tensely
between his thin lips.</p>

<p>The general brushed the first aside, completed,
and began the second. He paused and looked up.</p>

<p>“What was the woman’s name? Sonya something,
was it not?”</p>

<p>“Sonya Varanova, Freeman said,” returned the
prince’s even voice.</p>

<p>“Sonya Varanova,” the general repeated as he
wrote in the name. A minute later he affixed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
signature and his official seal and laid this warrant
with the other.</p>

<p>“On the other cases I shall postpone action,”
he said. “As for The White One, it might occasion
some criticism even among our own friends to execute
so old and crippled a woman.”</p>

<p>“What time have you set?” queried the prince.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six hours from now. Four o’clock
Thursday morning.”</p>

<p>Berloff adroitly let it be seen that an idea had
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“You have a suggestion?” asked the general.</p>

<p>“I was thinking this would have a more dumbfounding
effect if it came without warning—if
the revolutionists’ first news was the news that
all was over.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes. And it will show them how crushingly
determined is the Government!”</p>

<p>“Then I suggest that you take precaution against
your sentence leaking out. That you send along
with the warrants an order to the governor of the
Fortress that the prisoners are to be allowed to
speak to no one, and no one is to speak to them—that
is, without your permission.”</p>

<p>“An excellent precaution.” The general took
up his pen. As the order was finished his secretary
entered, and to him the general gave the orders
and the warrants. “Take these immediately over
to the governor of Peter and Paul.”</p>

<p>When the secretary had withdrawn, the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
arose. His pale face showed none of the exultant
triumph that filled his heart.</p>

<p>“Since all is done, I will be going,” he said.</p>

<p>The general’s red figure stood up. “An excellent
evening’s work, prince,” he said with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Excellent,” quietly acquiesced Berloff.</p>

<p>The general pushed the button on his desk and
followed Berloff into the darkened hall. “Andrei
here will show you out. Good-night.” In the
darkness the sleepy servant stumbled and upset
a chair. “Be careful there, you Andrei!” he called
out sharply. “You’ll disturb the princess!”</p>

<p>And yawning, and moving very lightly, the old
general went back to his bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE LAST CARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DREXEL turned from the Valenko mansion
a few minutes before Berloff and his party
entered it. Though harrowed by the evening’s
misfortune, there was a minor matter of which
he had to think as he slipped cautiously away—whither
should he take himself?</p>

<p>He could return to the Hotel Europe, and there
be safe, if he but kept near his uncle’s family and
had no communication with the revolutionists;
but this would be equivalent to deserting Sonya,
and deserting her in the hour of her direst need.
Sabatoff was still at liberty; if they two could consult
there was a chance, slender to be sure, but still
a chance, that they could evolve some plan whereby
Sonya and the other prisoners might be saved. Whatever
the danger to himself, he would try for that
slender chance.</p>

<p>But where should he go for the night? His home
of the past week was ashes, his friends scattered or
under arrest; to go to an hotel, no matter how obscure,
would be a dangerous risk, with all the city’s police
and spies on the watch for him; and as for walking
the street this arctic night, it meant, if not capture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
then at least a possible death from freezing. He
knew the address of but one free revolutionist,
Sabatoff, and to go to him at such a suspicious hour
involved the likelihood of bringing disaster upon
that important person. But somewhere he had
to go, and Sabatoff’s was the only where; and toward
his house he set out. Sabatoff, he judged, would
hardly be asleep after the evening’s catastrophe,
and would himself answer his ring. If one of the
Czar-loving servants came to the door, he would
leave some message in keeping with his gendarme’s
uniform and go away.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s walk Drexel came to Sabatoff’s
house. He searched the street with his eyes;
it was empty, and confident that he was unobserved,
he stepped quickly into the doorway and rang.
There was a long wait; then steps sounded and the
door opened. He had been right in his conjecture.
The person at the door was Sabatoff.</p>

<p>“It is I—Drexel,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Sabatoff drew him in. “Quick, then—and
silent.”</p>

<p>With no other word the official led the way up a
flight of stairs and into a room which Drexel saw
was the library. In a minute footsteps shuffled by.
Sabatoff opened the door an inch.</p>

<p>“You need not bother, Pavel,” he called. “I
answered the ring. It was only a telegram.”</p>

<p>There was a sleepy mumble, then the footsteps
faded away toward the top of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Sabatoff locked the door. Drexel now made known
his need of shelter, and Sabatoff assured him that he
could have refuge in this same room till the morrow;
that sofa there could be his bed. Drexel then spoke
of the possibility of freeing the prisoners. Sabatoff
saw little hope, but favoured trying their utmost.
However, it would be a waste of time to discuss a
scheme until they knew just how matters stood. He
would acquaint himself with the situation to-morrow,
and they would then consider plans.</p>

<p>After Drexel had related his night’s experiences,
Sabatoff withdrew—not that he expected to sleep,
but it was wisdom to avoid the possibility of his servants
missing him from his bed. Though the hour
was already four, the night that followed was the
longest of Drexel’s life. He could not have a light,
he could not move about—either might reveal to
the servants that a stranger was in the house. He
could only lie motionless upon the couch and wait—wait—wait
for the morrow, and think of Sonya in
her damp and gloomy dungeon.</p>

<p>Morning came at length. Sabatoff smuggled in
some fruit and bread. “I have told my servants
that I have locked this room to make sure that some
papers I have been arranging shall not be disturbed,”
he said. “I may not be back till afternoon. Anyhow,
it will not be safe for you to leave the house
till it’s dark again.”</p>

<p>The hours that followed were like the hours that
had gone before; hours of tense, inactive waiting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
filled with thoughts of Sonya. Once, to be sure,
he did recall that to-morrow his cousin was to be
married to Berloff, and that he had as yet done
nothing to save her from what could only be gilded
misery with that relentless villain. But Alice’s
approaching misfortune was quickly obliterated
by the far greater disaster of her who was a thousand
times more dear to him—her whom he had kissed
once, then lost.</p>

<p>Three o’clock came, and with it darkness. Soon
Sabatoff entered the room, locked the door, and lit
the gas. There was an ominous whiteness in his face.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Drexel whispered, new terror in
his heart.</p>

<p>“This afternoon while in my office a record passed
through my hands that told me something it was
plain we revolutionists were not intended to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes?”</p>

<p>“The worst has happened. Sonya and Borodin
are condemned to die.”</p>

<p>Drexel’s legs gave way beneath him and he sank
slowly to the couch. “Condemned to die?”</p>

<p>Sabatoff nodded. “Condemned by their father.”</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>Drexel’s lips formed: “When do they——” and
stilled.</p>

<p>“At four to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“In twelve hours!” he breathed.</p>

<p>Even in this reeling moment Drexel recognized
that Freeman was in this crowning calamity. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
had not his hand been stronger out there upon the
frozen river! And he recognized in it the diabolic
cunning of Berloff—and he recognized that the
prince’s motive was the Valenko fortune.</p>

<p>He sprang up frantically. “We must do something—at
once!”</p>

<p>“Yes—but what?” said Sabatoff.</p>

<p>What indeed? What could their scattered forces
do against those mighty walls, in the bare dozen
hours that remained? The two men gazed at each
other in silence.</p>

<p>After a moment Drexel gave a start. “There
is only one chance!” he breathed quickly.</p>

<p>“And that?”</p>

<p>“I am certain General Valenko does not know
whom he condemned. If he is told, he may do
something.”</p>

<p>“And then again he may not. You know what a
stern old Roman he is.”</p>

<p>“But he loves his daughter!”</p>

<p>“And even if he wants to save them he may be able
to do little,” continued Sabatoff. “In the eyes of
the Government Sonya and Borodin are flagrantly
guilty. The Government may be inclined to treat
them with especial harshness as examples to warn
the rest of the nobility from the same course.”</p>

<p>“But he may be able to postpone the execution,”
Drexel cried desperately. “Or have it changed
to exile to Siberia for life. This is better, at least,
than death in a few hours. It is worth trying!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“Worth trying—yes. I was not against the plan.
I was merely pointing out that we should be conservative
in our hopes—that there is only a bare
chance.”</p>

<p>“A bare chance, yes—but an only chance! I
shall go at once!”</p>

<p>Sabatoff caught his arm. “Wait! It’s walking
into the lion’s den. He may put his duty above his
love. If he does, he will surely arrest the messenger
as being another revolutionist. I shall go myself.”</p>

<p>There was a debate upon this point, but Sabatoff
had to yield. “Very well. But you must not
go to him in that uniform; that may suggest to him
that you are the stranger who escaped last night
as a gendarme. I shall send my servants away on
errands for half an hour, and in the meantime you
can get into some of my clothes and leave the house
unobserved.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Drexel slipped cautiously
from the house, and after walking swiftly for a
block caught a sleigh. As he sped along he built
a plan upon his hope that Sonya’s sentence might be
commuted to exile to Siberia. He would organize
a secret expedition, manage her escape from the
mines of Eastern Siberia or from some stockaded
prison above the Arctic circle, fly with her to the
Pacific coast and carry her to safety in America.</p>

<p>As he drew up before the Valenko palace he
cast a glance up at the softly glowing windows of
the princess’s sick-room, then hurriedly rang.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Luckily the general was in and Drexel was ushered
back into his home office.</p>

<p>The general rose from his papers and greeted
Drexel with that finished courtesy which even the
harshest of Russia’s high officials bestow upon
foreigners. “You left us very suddenly out at
Prince Berloff’s, Mr. Drexel,” he said. “You have
just got back from Moscow, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“In good time for Miss Howard’s marriage.
And how is my niece?”</p>

<p>“I have not yet seen her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, out I suppose. She is in great demand.
She will make a very popular Russian, your cousin.”
He held out a golden cigarette case.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to smoke—thank you, prince.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I do,” and he lit a cigarette and
settled back in comfort.</p>

<p>“I—the fact is,” Drexel began with an effort,
“this is not a social call. I should have said so.
I came on business.”</p>

<p>“Business?” The prince raised his heavy eyebrows.
“I am at your service.”</p>

<p>For a moment Drexel hesitated; and for that moment
he wondered how that stern old warrior, puffing
there at his ease, would take the revelation about
his son and daughter. Would he inflexibly allow
their execution to go on? And he had an instantaneous
fear for himself. Would he order his arrest when
he guessed his connection with the revolutionists?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“I am at your service,” the prince repeated.</p>

<p>“I came about two prisoners whom you ordered
to be executed to-morrow morning—Borodin and
Sonya Varanova.”</p>

<p>The prince straightened up. “How did you
learn of this, Mr. Drexel?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“It does not matter, since it is true. Do you
know who Borodin is?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Drexel, if I refuse to be catechized
upon matters pertaining to my official business,”
he returned, coldly.</p>

<p>“And pardon me, prince, if I insist.”</p>

<p>The tense seriousness of Drexel caught his attention.
“Eh—what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Do you know who he is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose there is no reason why I should
not tell you; it will be all over the city to-morrow.
He is Borski.”</p>

<p>Drexel leaned forward. “Yes—but do you know
who else he is?”</p>

<p>“I think that knowing he is Borski is quite
enough,” was the grim response.</p>

<p>“Not enough for you, prince.”</p>

<p>“For me? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That for you he is some one far more important
than Borski.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Prince Vladimir Valenko.”</p>

<p>The commanding figure rose, and the ruddy
colour fled his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“My son?”</p>

<p>“Your son.”</p>

<p>“You are—you are certain of this?”</p>

<p>“Certain.”</p>

<p>He stared at Drexel in dumbfoundment.</p>

<p>Drexel stood up. “And do you know who Sonya
Varanova is?”</p>

<p>“Who is she?”</p>

<p>“Princess Olga Valenko.”</p>

<p>“Olga!” he gasped.</p>

<p>His face overspread with ashy horror. But the
next instant it cleared, and he gave a cry of relief.</p>

<p>“It’s all a mistake, Mr. Drexel! But for a
moment, how you did frighten me!”</p>

<p>“It is not a mistake!”</p>

<p>“It is, and the proof of it is that my daughter
is in this house, dangerously ill.”</p>

<p>“But should she not be in this house, what would
that prove?”</p>

<p>“Not in this house?” He fell back a pace.</p>

<p>“Look in her room,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>The prince gazed a moment at Drexel’s pale face,
then turned and fairly plunged away. “Keep the
deception from the servants,” Drexel warned in a
whisper as he went through the door.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he reëntered the room. His
face was blanched and was filled with fear and
horror. “She’s not there—you may be right—I
am going to the Fortress,” he said in a husky
whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>He started out. Drexel caught his arm.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“But I must know what you do!”</p>

<p>“Wait here, then,” he said.</p>

<p>A chaos of fear, doubt, pride, shame and wrath,
the prince sent his horse galloping past the palaces
that border the Neva, over the Palace Bridge, and
through the dark, arched gateway of the Fortress.
Here he sprang from his sleigh and started to hurry
into the governor’s office; then remembering himself,
he slowed down and strode in with all the dignity
of a military governor.</p>

<p>The place of the imprisoned Governor Delwig had
been that day filled by Colonel Kavelin of Odessa,
who had previously been determined on as Delwig’s
successor and who had arrived in St. Petersburg the
evening before. The new chief of the prison, burly,
heavy-faced, greeted Prince Valenko with obsequious,
flurried pleasure, which the prince returned
with the hauteur that a high official gives one far
beneath him.</p>

<p>“I came over, Colonel Kavelin,” he said, “on a
matter of business concerning the prisoners Borodin
and Sonya Varanova.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the gratified governor. “All is
ready for the execution. Everything will be carried
out just as Your Excellency commanded.”</p>

<p>“I desire to examine them upon certain points.
Let me see them at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Certainly. Will Your Excellency examine them
here? I can be a witness to their testimony, and
my clerk here can take it down.”</p>

<p>“No. I wish to see them in their cells, alone.
Put them both into one cell.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done immediately,” said the governor,
and withdrew.</p>

<p>He presently returned, and led the prince through
chill, dark corridors. The utter prison stillness was
broken only by the chimes of the Fortress Cathedral,
sounding out the hymn, “How Glorious is Our
God in Zion.” Before the dungeon doors stood
silent guards. Here was the dungeon said to be the
one in which Peter the Great with his own hand slew
his son Alexis; here the dungeons in which Catherine
the Great entombed those who dared lift their voices
against her murder of her husband. Dungeons of
a black and awful past, of a black and awful present.</p>

<p>Colonel Kavelin stopped and thrust a key into a
door. Prince Valenko asked the governor to call
for him in fifteen minutes; then he stepped into the
dungeon and the bolts grated behind him.</p>

<p>There was a table, a chair and a bed, all chained
to the granite wall. On the table burned a single
candle, on the bed sat a man and a woman, their
arms about each other.</p>

<p>The prince stood stock still, all his fears come true.
The pair arose. For a space father and children
gazed at each other in a silence that was a part of
the vast chill silence of this vast cold tomb. First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
the prince’s gaze had centred on Sonya; then on the
son whom he had not seen these five years—a
man of thirty, as tall as his father, but more slender,
with soft, dark hair brushed straight back from a
broad forehead. There were dignity and nobility
and power in his bearing, and high purpose glowed
in his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>It was Sonya that ended the silence. She took a
hesitant step forward.</p>

<p>“Father!” she whispered.</p>

<p>He did not move. Now that doubt and suspense
were over, it was the turn of wrath. His cheeks
slowly crimsoned, the thick gray brows drew together,
and from beneath them flashed an awful fire.</p>

<p>“So!” he burst out; “these two political criminals
are my own children!”</p>

<p>They did not speak.</p>

<p>His figure seemed to swell with wrathful majesty.
“My own children!” he ejaculated. “The Czar
had faith in me. He made me military governor
of St. Petersburg because he thought that I, above
all others, was the one to subdue the revolt in this
the heart of Russia. And now, at the head of that
revolt I find my own son, my own daughter! My
own children the arch-traitors!”</p>

<p>“Not traitors, father,” said Sonya, “but patriots
of a truer sort!”</p>

<p>“Traitors, I say! As for Vladimir there, I may
not be surprised. But you, Sonya, you whom I
loved and cherished and trusted, of whom I was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
proud—to think that you could secretly join these
vile enemies of our country!”</p>

<p>“Our country’s enemies!” Borodin repeated
quietly, but with a quick flashing of his eyes. “Who
are they? Those who are crushing it into darkness, or
those who are striving to lift it into liberty and light?”</p>

<p>“Silence! Nothing from you!” cried the general.
“It is you that led Sonya into this. You are the
sole cause of our disgrace and shame!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps another generation will not call it shame.”</p>

<p>The quiet answer only roused the proud old
autocrat the more.</p>

<p>“But, father,” put in Sonya quickly, “at such
a time as this cannot we forget these differences——”</p>

<p>“Forget! How forget, when to-morrow all St.
Petersburg, all Russia, will know that the children
of General Valenko are traitors? Can I forget this
disgrace upon the name that for a thousand years
has been one of Russia’s proudest?”</p>

<p>“That disgrace,” returned Borodin steadily, “may
later prove the Valenkos’ greatest honour.”</p>

<p>His father did not heed him. “To-morrow our
name will be in the mire,” he went on with mounting
wrath. “To-morrow I shall be sneered at all over
the land. The revolution-queller, who found the
revolution sprang from his own family! How
Russia will laugh!”</p>

<p>His voice grew even more wroth, and his face
darkened with accusation. “You have turned
against your father—you have turned against your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
class—you have turned against your Czar! But
one disgrace I shall not suffer. They shall never
say of me that I shrank from duty because the criminals
were my own children. You are guilty!
You must suffer the penalty of your guilt!”</p>

<p>He stood before them the very figure on an heroic
scale of a wrathful, implacable, almighty judge.
There was a moment of deep silence. Through the
heavy masonry came the tones of the Cathedral clock,
tolling the hour of six.</p>

<p>“We knew the risk, and we accepted it,” said
Borodin. “So we do not complain at your decision.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are doing your duty as you see it,”
said Sonya. “But even if we cannot agree, father,
can we not admit that we all have tried to do what
we have thought best for our own country, and part
without blame or bitterness?”</p>

<p>She took Borodin’s arm and drew him forward,
front to front with his infuriate sire and judge.
“Since we are parting forever, won’t you and Vladimir
part as friends, father?”</p>

<p>The general gazed at his son—at his daughter.
They were pale, but their eyes were clear, their
mien tranquilly intrepid. Their calm acceptance
of their fate sobered his wrath, but stern judgment
still sat upon his brow.</p>

<p>At length he spoke. “And you are willing to die?”
he asked his son.</p>

<p>“Since it must be so—yes.”</p>

<p>“And you, Sonya?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“I do not want to die, but I am quite ready.”</p>

<p>“And do you not regret what you have done?”</p>

<p>“I only regret,” said she, “that it all turned out
so ill.”</p>

<p>There was a knock at the dungeon’s door, and the
governor called that the fifteen minutes were at an end.</p>

<p>The general paled. A spasmodic twitching
rippled across his stern, strong face.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” he said.</p>

<p>Sonya stretched out to him both her hands and
her eyes filled with tears. “Good-bye, father.
And in the—the future—try to see that the cause
we died for——”</p>

<p>There was a breaking, a surging up, within him,
and suddenly his arms opened and he clutched her
to him.</p>

<p>“No! No! You shall not die!” he cried convulsively.
“You shall not die—neither of you!
I’ll move heaven and earth! I’ll arrange it somehow.
How, I do not know—but I’ll arrange it!”</p>

<p>He kissed her again and again, tears flushing
his old eyes; and he embraced and kissed his disowned
son. Then he tore himself from their arms,
saying that the time was short, that he must make
haste, and that they should have no fear.</p>

<p>At the door he paused a moment to regain his
calm. “I am ready, Colonel Kavelin,” he called.
The bolts grated back and he strode out into the
governor’s company, with the cold, haughty, indifferent
bearing that becomes an autocrat.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE PRINCE PLAYS TRUMPS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS THE general strode through the cell-lined
corridors he swiftly planned his course.
He had power to condemn, but in a case of
such flagrant guilt he had not power to pardon.
He would return to his home, send the governor
an official order staying the execution, and then
hasten straight to the Czar and beg for clemency.
He would keep the identity of the prisoners secret,
save only from his royal master, and thus, barring
misfortune, he and his name would emerge from
the situation without public disgrace.</p>

<p>He came out into the court, where he had left
his sleigh, to find standing there a score of cavalry.
The officer in charge, a captain whom he knew,
rode up to him, dismounted, and saluting respectfully,
handed him an envelope.</p>

<p>“I was sent to give this to Your Excellency,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Thank you.” The general started to put it in
his coat.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Your Excellency, but I was to
request you to examine it at once.”</p>

<p>The general opened the envelope and read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“It is with extreme regret that we find it advisable
to remove you temporarily from office and
place you under domiciliary arrest until six o’clock
to-morrow morning. During this period you are not
to communicate with anyone whatever, by speech
or writing, except your guards who will be with you
constantly.</p>

<p>“There is no desire to dishonour you. If you will
submit yourself quietly to this order, and will promise
to make no effort to break its provisions, only the
bearer of the order and his two lieutenants need
accompany you. No attention will be attracted and
the fact of your temporary restraint will never reach
the public.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Nicholas.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The general stood there in the snow and stared
at the paper. All his blood seemed to flow out of
him.</p>

<p>His way to the Czar was blocked—blocked by
the Czar’s own hand. He could not even send the
intended reprieve. He was as helpless as though
bound and gagged.</p>

<p>And his children would die under his own death
warrants!</p>

<p>He knew the power he served too well not to know
that his only course was submission. If he did not
go quietly, he would go under a heavy guard, and the
only difference would be the public disgrace.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together with a great effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and pocketed the order. “I will go with you,” he
said to the captain.</p>

<p>The captain saluted.</p>

<p>The prince touched his pocket. “You know the
contents of this?”</p>

<p>“I know only my orders.” He again saluted.
“Shall I ride with you?”</p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>The captain gave his horse to one of his men to be
led, and the two got into the sleigh. The prince
then remembered that his children would be expecting
every minute up to the last the reprieve that
now was not to come. They ought to be spared
that long suspense with its climax of disappointment,
but he knew it was useless to ask to speak
with them.</p>

<p>He was aware that the governor was behind them,
though he pretended ignorance of the fact. “I
was examining two condemned prisoners,” he
remarked to the captain, but for the governor’s ear.
“They asked a slight favour of me which I promised
to consider. Will you have one of your men tell the
governor to inform them that I can do nothing for
them.”</p>

<p>“I will see they are told,” eagerly put in the
governor.</p>

<p>The captain looked as if he half considered this to
be a breach of orders; but the prince gave him no
chance to object.</p>

<p>“Let us start,” he said quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>The sleigh moved off through the arched gateway,
two officers riding beside it, and the rest of the
troop following at a distance. To Governor Kavelin,
and to all whom they passed, the cavalcade seemed
merely an escort of honour. But beneath the
prince’s calm surface he was revolving frantic
measures. He thought of telling the captain at
his side that the condemned ones were his children,
and begging his aid; but he knew the captain had his
orders and would dare not disobey. He thought
of rising in his sleigh and crying out to the people,
but he knew this would not avail to save his children.
This would do nothing but spectacularly publish his
own disgrace. So he rode on with closed lips, a cold,
proud figure.</p>

<p>The three officers accompanied him into his office,
where Drexel sat waiting. As they entered, Drexel
sprang up.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes?” he cried.</p>

<p>The prince, surrounded by his guards, could
only gaze at Drexel in his commanded silence.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, what does this mean?” Drexel
demanded in dismay.</p>

<p>Thus abjured, the prince opened his mouth. “I
am——”</p>

<p>“Stop, prince!” the captain broke in. “Remember,
you cannot speak.”</p>

<p>“He cannot speak?” cried Drexel.</p>

<p>“Such is the order.”</p>

<p>“But I must know! I must know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“He can say nothing,” said the captain in a tone
of finality.</p>

<p>Drexel stared at the prince in helpless despair.
The prince turned to the captain.</p>

<p>“I may not speak to him, I know. But I may
to you. This gentleman has sought my interest
in a certain matter. It will be no breach of your
orders for you to inform him that I am under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Under arrest!” exclaimed Drexel.</p>

<p>“And that I can do nothing whatever in the
affair,” the prince concluded.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” breathed Drexel.</p>

<p>“I think the gentleman understands,” said the
captain. “I am sure he will excuse me when I say
that it is necessary for him to withdraw.”</p>

<p>Drexel stumbled out of the palace. He leaned
upon the river’s parapet and gazed wildly across
the night at the dim outlines of the Fortress.</p>

<p>The last card played—and trumped!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Drexel thought he knew the worst. Doubtless
he did, but he did not know all.</p>

<p>At the time that Drexel stood gazing across at
Sonya’s prison, word was brought to Prince Berloff
that his plan for the arrest of General Valenko had
had successful issue. The fear of the last hour,
since he had been told that the general had gone to
the Fortress, gave place to exultant satisfaction.
Yes, it was fortunate that he had foreseen the
danger that the general might learn the identity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the two prisoners, and had had the general’s every
movement shadowed, prepared instantly to checkmate
him. And it was fortunate, too, that he had
had by him blank orders with the Czar’s signature
attached, entrusted to him by Nicholas for use in
extreme emergency.</p>

<p>Upon his self-congratulation there entered Freeman.
Freeman reported that he had been searching
for Drexel ever since he had left Berloff the night
before, but that thus far he had not a clue.</p>

<p>“No clue yet!” exclaimed the prince. “And only
ten hours remain! After the execution he will be
sure to return to the Howards, and then we cannot
touch him.”</p>

<p>“Correct,” was the easy response. “And in the
meantime he is hiding with the revolutionists, and
there is little chance of our finding him by ordinary
police methods in these ten hours.”</p>

<p>“Then he will escape unless we use some clever,
quick-working plan!”</p>

<p>“Exactly, prince.” Freeman’s eyes gleamed
between their puffy, blackened lids. “And so we
are going to use a clever, quick-working plan.”</p>

<p>“Then you have one?”</p>

<p>“A great one! Princess Valenko knows every
revolutionist that Drexel knows. Also she believes
me under arrest, and does not suspect me. You are
to have me put in the cell with her and her brother,
as condemned to die—and trust me, in the emotional
before-the-scaffold hour, as a fellow prisoner doomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
to die at the same time, to worm out of her the name
of every possible person with whom Drexel can be
in hiding.”</p>

<p>“I see! I see!”</p>

<p>“Then when I’m released,” Freeman went on
excitedly, “we’ll swoop down on every person whose
name I’ve learned. We’ll get him, sure! And we’ll
get every leader of importance still free in St.
Petersburg!”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” ejaculated the prince.</p>

<p>The triumphant light that leaped up in his eyes
as suddenly died out.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Freeman, there is one weak spot in
the plan.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday’s attempt to free Borodin shows that
the revolutionists have very likely won over, or
bought over, a number of the prison staff. Some
of these guards might get warning to the prisoners
that you are not condemned to die. Then they
would be suspicious and tell you nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ve foreseen that danger, and have devised my
plan to avoid it. I am to be really condemned to
death.”</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“I mean that you are to have a real death warrant
made out for me. Then no one in the prison, not
even the governor, will know what we’re about.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that avoids the danger!”</p>

<p>“And then an hour before the execution you send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
an officer with an order for my release. No—wait.
Now that I think of it, I don’t care to have
that order trusted to any stupid officer. Suppose
he failed to get there on time—eh? Prince, you
must bring it yourself.”</p>

<p>This fitted Berloff’s desire; for being in the Fortress
at the time of the execution, he would not have
to wait till morning to learn definitely that he had
won the great stake for which he had so craftily
played.</p>

<p>“Very well; I will bring it myself.”</p>

<p>“Say at three o’clock?”</p>

<p>“At three o’clock.”</p>

<p>Freeman rose to go. “One moment,” said the
prince. He paused, then went on quietly. “You
will recall that two or three weeks ago we considered
the desirability of a terroristic plot against
General Valenko.”</p>

<p>Freeman smiled cynically. “Whose misfortune
it was to stand between you and his fortune. Yes,
I remember.”</p>

<p>“We dropped it then because the revolutionists
refused to be involved. They will now be burning
to avenge the general’s execution of their comrades.
Might not this be a good time to take it up again?”</p>

<p>Freeman’s sinister intelligence read what was in
the prince’s mind. “With the two children out of the
way, why wait years for the general’s natural death
to give you possession of his fortune—eh, prince?
Besides, if you waited, he might come to suspect your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
part in to-night’s business and will his fortune elsewhere.
You are right—this is the very time.”</p>

<p>“Then you will undertake the matter at once?”</p>

<p>“I will begin on it to-morrow—as soon as Drexel
is done for. Prince, allow me to congratulate you.
Victory over the revolutionists—two vast fortunes
the same as won to-night—a beautiful bride
to-morrow—and the Prime Ministership certain
to be yours! How the devil must love his favourite
child!”</p>

<p>The prince frowned, but his heart leaped at the
summary of his success.</p>

<p>They settled the further details of their plans, and
an hour later Freeman, in coarse prison clothes,
was thrust into the dungeon with Sonya and
Borodin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>A DESPERATE PLAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE death silence that broods over the sombre
dungeons of Peter and Paul brooded also
over the library of Sabatoff. Drexel and
the Keeper of the Seals sat looking each at the
other’s drawn face, or paced the room with frantic
strides, now and then glancing at the cold impassive
clock whose ticking seemed the relentless footsteps
of the approaching hour when Sonya and Borodin
must mount the scaffold. They had nothing to say
to each other. They could do nothing. They
could only dumbly wait till the clock knelled four.</p>

<p>And never a dream had either of them of the
deadly intelligence Freeman was even now subtly
drawing from the condemned pair—that at almost
the same hour the end came in the Fortress, so Freeman
planned, the end would also come here.</p>

<p>Eight!... Nine!... Ten!</p>

<p>As if revealed by lightning flashes, Drexel had
swift visions of Sonya. He saw her in her dungeon,
now and then lifting her head to listen to the slow
pacing of the death watch at her door, or to the
tower of the Fortress Cathedral, far up in the night,
chiming “The Glory of God in Zion”; saw a look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
of despair darken her face as she thought how near
her end was, how little she had done, how desperate
was her people’s need; saw her led forth from her cell
and through the silent corridors of this great catacomb
whose tenants were the living dead, and out
to where waited the gallows-tree; saw her mount
the steps, her face white but calm, and lighted
with a glory as though granted a Mosaic vision of
the land she might not enter. And then he saw——</p>

<p>He gave a low cry. Sabatoff glanced at him but
did not speak.</p>

<p>“Can we not do something?” Drexel moaned.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything! Anything!”</p>

<p>Sabatoff answered with the quiet of one long
accustomed to tragedies such as this, who himself
expected some day to be a victim. “The hope that
General Valenko might save them was our last
and only chance.”</p>

<p>“But we cannot just sit here and watch that
clock creep round to four!” Drexel sprang up desperately.
“Can’t we at least go out and publicly
proclaim the identity of Sonya and Borodin? In
hotels, restaurants, theatres!”</p>

<p>“What will that do?”</p>

<p>“Why, the roused public will never let the prince
and princess of so great a family die on the scaffold!”</p>

<p>“Even if we succeeded in rousing the people, they
could not move the Government.”</p>

<p>“But let’s try, man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“If so high an official as General Valenko tried to
save them and was arrested, what can the people do?
No, that plan would only be a vain waste of these
last few hours.”</p>

<p>“But, God, there must be something we can do!”</p>

<p>“I wish there was!” groaned Sabatoff.</p>

<p>Drexel dropped into a chair and buried his face
in his hands, and tried with pure muscle to press
an idea from his aching forehead. But he could
not long sit thus. He paced the floor—thinking—thinking—wildly
thinking. He looked at the clock.
“Half past ten!” he breathed, and continued his
frantic walk. Sabatoff’s eyes followed him in keen
sympathy; deeply as he felt the impending tragedy
on his own account, he felt an especial pang on
Drexel’s, for it was easy guessing what lay behind
Drexel’s agonized concern.</p>

<p>Suddenly Drexel paused. A tense excitement
dawned upon his face.</p>

<p>His strange look drew Sabatoff to his feet. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>Drexel tried to speak calmly. “Was not Borodin,
when first arrested, held in some other prison?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the Central Prison.”</p>

<p>“And the reason you did not know where he was,
was because he had been secretly removed?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“These removals are common, are they not?
Especially into a stronger prison?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Is there a stronger prison in Russia than Peter
and Paul?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“But are not prisoners sometimes transferred from
Peter and Paul?”</p>

<p>“Many of the most feared life-prisoners are sent
to Schlusselburg.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I remember now. And where is
Schlusselburg?”</p>

<p>“Forty versts away, on an island in Lake Ladoga.
But, Mr. Drexel—what are you driving at?”</p>

<p>Drexel clutched the other’s shoulder and the
excitement he had repressed now blazed forth.</p>

<p>“We are going to remove Sonya and Borodin to
Schlusselburg!”</p>

<p>Sabatoff stared. “Remove them to Schlusselburg?”
he repeated blankly.</p>

<p>“Yes—to Schlusselburg!”</p>

<p>“Are you out of your head?”</p>

<p>“Or at least Schlusselburg is where we will pretend
to start for. But once out of Peter and Paul
we march solemnly along for a way, then——”</p>

<p>“Then disappear. I see that. Once out of
Peter and Paul, the rest is easy. But how will you
get them out?”</p>

<p>“By an order.”</p>

<p>“By an order?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by an order! You have all kinds of official
blanks, you have copies of the signatures of all
important officials. By an order made out by you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Sabatoff’s eyes opened wide. “You are thinking
of a regular official removal?” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Of a removal that will appear so regular and
official that it will deceive every one for a few hours.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you propose to walk calmly into
the Fortress, calmly request the prisoners, and then
calmly walk out with them?”</p>

<p>“As calmly as I can.”</p>

<p>“But there is not one chance in a hundred that the
plan will succeed!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. But that hundredth chance is the
only chance!”</p>

<p>“It’s either the idea of a madman—or a genius!”
Sabatoff’s face caught the excited blaze of Drexel’s.
“Yes, it’s the only chance!” he cried, and he held
out his hand. “And who knows—we may succeed!”</p>

<p>For a moment they silently gripped hands upon
the dangerous adventure; then their tongues fell
busy about details. Would the governor of the
prison accept the forged order without suspicion,
and act upon it? Perhaps not; indeed, most likely
not, for Colonel Kavelin was reputed an ideal jailer,
shrewd, watchful, versed in the thousand tricks of
caged people who long and scheme for liberty. But
that he should not was one of the risks.</p>

<p>An escort would be necessary to act as guard to
the prisoners, but the escort would be an easy matter.
Sabatoff would provide the men, and there were
secret stores of uniforms prepared for use in just
such exigencies as this. It was decided that Drexel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
should lead the adventure alone; not that Sabatoff
lacked courage, but he lacked what was equally
requisite in a daring venture like this, coolness and
readiness of wit in a crisis.</p>

<p>At the last they had a moment of vivid dismay.
Drexel, with his broken speech, could never pass as
a Russian officer. But a second thought disposed
of this difficulty. There were plenty of French
officers in the Russian service, and they mutilated
the native tongue quite as atrociously as he. He
would be a Frenchman.</p>

<p>It was now eleven. Sabatoff hastened away to
arrange for the escort, leaving Drexel with nothing
to do but watch the clock hands. Twelve o’clock
came—one. How time strode irresistibly on!
Only three more hours! Suppose something had
happened to Sabatoff—arrest, perhaps—and he
should not return?</p>

<p>But presently Drexel heard a key in the outer
door, then light footsteps, and then Sabatoff entered
the library.</p>

<p>“There was difficulty about collecting the men at
so late an hour,” he whispered. “But all is well.”
He handed Drexel a bundle. “By the time you get
into that uniform I’ll have everything in readiness.”</p>

<p>While Drexel was changing from civilian to gendarme
officer, Sabatoff first wrote out the forged
order, then took up the telephone on his desk and
called a number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Is this Peter and Paul?” he asked after a
moment.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I want to speak to the governor.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. “Is this Governor
Kavelin?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Sabatoff’s voice had taken on a tone of cold, supercilious
politeness. “This is the second secretary of
General Pavloff, administrator of prisons. General
Pavloff presents his compliments to Colonel Kavelin
and begs to inform him that the Czar in his clemency
has commuted the sentence of the prisoners Borodin
and Sonya Varanova to life imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m all ready to execute them!” exclaimed
the governor.</p>

<p>“The administrator also wishes me to inform
you,” Sabatoff went on, “that it has been decided
to remove these two prisoners, together with Razoff
and the White One, to Schlusselburg.”</p>

<p>“Remove them to Schlusselburg!” cried the
governor. “What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“I dare say that if General Pavloff had wished
you to know the reason he would have instructed me
to inform you,” was the cool response.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” Colonel Kavelin returned angrily,
“but it seems to me that General Pavloff, knowing
my record, could have considered the prisoners
perfectly safe in my charge!”</p>

<p>“I am not authorized to answer for General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Pavloff. Do you know Captain Laroque of the
gendarmerie?—who was recently transferred here
from Moscow?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Captain Laroque will be over within an hour
with a guard and with an order for the prisoners.
A special train will carry them to Schlusselburg.
Have the prison van ready to take them to the
station. The administrator asks that you make all
haste when the captain comes.”</p>

<p>Sabatoff hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you pretty high-handed with him?”
suggested Drexel.</p>

<p>“I had to be; that’s the manner of the administrator’s
office. And you have got to be high-handed,
too, for this Captain Laroque is one of the most
brutal men in all the gendarmerie.”</p>

<p>“Do I look the part?”</p>

<p>Sabatoff glanced over the well-set figure in the
long gray coat and top boots, with sword and pistol
at the belt.</p>

<p>“You’ll do very well if you remember to mix in
plenty of scowls and curses.”</p>

<p>A minute later they softly opened the front door
and peered out. The little street was as empty as the
night overhead, save for a driverless sleigh beside the
curb. This they got into, and choosing the obscurest
streets they drove swiftly to the south. Here in a
mean, unlighted street, Sabatoff drew up before the
vaguely seen gateway of a court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“Here we are,” he whispered.</p>

<p>He softly coughed twice. In a few seconds
through the gateway filed a dozen shadowy figures.
Despite the darkness Drexel could see they wore the
uniform of gendarmes.</p>

<p>“Captain Laroque,” Sabatoff whispered to
them.</p>

<p>They touched their caps.</p>

<p>“They know what to do,” Sabatoff whispered
to Drexel. “When all is over, abandon the sleigh;
there’s no clue connecting it with me. And all luck
with you!”</p>

<p>They clasped hands, and Sabatoff stepped from the
sleigh and disappeared into a cross street. Drexel
started the horse into a walk and the men fell into
double file behind him. As they passed a street
lamp Drexel looked back to take the measure of his
escort. Of the front pair one nodded at him, and
the other gave him a wink and a grin.</p>

<p>“Nicolai—Ivan!” he breathed.</p>

<p>Nicolai responded with a formal salute. Ivan’s
pock-marked face grinned again and his little eyes
glinted with excitement. “Great business!” he
whispered, nodding his head.</p>

<p>As they moved on Drexel’s suspense tightened.
One chance in a hundred, Sabatoff had said, and
on so desperate a hazard hung the life of Sonya.
Yes, and Borodin’s life, and his own, and if not the
lives at least the freedom of Razoff, The White One,
and the dozen of his escort. And the slightest mistake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
the slightest misfortune, would instantly be
the ruin of all!</p>

<p>His foremost fear was that he might be intercepted
before he reached the prison. The city
was filled with soldiers, the gendarmerie were
skulking everywhere; what more natural than that
some squad should fall in with them, penetrate their
deception and place them under arrest? Drexel
expected some late-prowling company to rush out
upon them as they passed every dark cross street—as
they passed the huge pile of St. Isaac’s Cathedral,
whose cavernous shadows seemed the lurking place
of surprises—as they passed the Winter Palace
of the Czar—as they traversed the long bridge that
arched the Neva’s ice. But save for a few sleighs
and a sleepy policeman or two, the streets were void
and silent—as silent as though frozen by the bitter
cold; and without having been once addressed
they drew nigh the mighty Fortress.</p>

<p>Before the dark gateway—how many lofty souls
had entered there never to come out!—he paused,
almost choking with the nearness of the climax.
Even the night seemed to hold its breath. Fifteen
more minutes would decide it all. Fifteen more
minutes and Sonya would be free—or he, too,
would be a prisoner in the bowels of the Fortress.</p>

<p>Other fears suddenly assailed him. Suppose the
governor should detect something wrong in the
order for the prisoners? Or, worse still—and
what more likely?—suppose the governor, desiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
instruction upon some detail of the transfer,
had called up the real administrator of prisons and
had thus laid bare the plot?—and even now was
cunningly waiting for him to appear to snap the
prison doors behind him like the doors of a trap?</p>

<p>A hundred chances against them? Standing
beneath those frowning walls, the odds seemed worse
a hundred times than that!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>THE JAWS OF DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT the odds had to be taken.</p>

<p>“Ring the bell, Ivan,” Drexel ordered.
Ivan did so, and the gates slowly creaked
open upon their frozen hinges. A sentry appeared,
looking more a bear than a man in his huge sheepskin
coat.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Captain Laroque,” Drexel gruffly returned.</p>

<p>“Come in, captain.”</p>

<p>Drexel drove into the prison yard, more than half
expecting the gates to close behind him with a clang.
They did not, but that proved nothing. The governor
would wait till he had him in the prison itself
before he sprang the trap.</p>

<p>In the court the prison van stood ready. But that
also proved nothing.</p>

<p>Drexel stepped from his sleigh, his nerves as
taut as violin strings, and crossed to the prison
entrance. Suddenly from the blackness overhead
there rushed down a wild tumult of bells. He
stood frozen in his tracks. This was the signal,
the alarm! He looked to see every door burst open
and belch out scores of guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>The next moment his heart beat again. That
horrific alarm was only the chimes of the Fortress
Cathedral hymning “Glory to God in Zion,” and
announcing that it was three of the night.</p>

<p>He put his guards in charge of the van, then
crossed the court and entered the governor’s office.
Colonel Kavelin, who sat at his desk smoking a
cigarette and making an erasure in a record with
a big knife, stood stiffly up. Drexel glanced keenly
into the broad bearded face. There was a glint
to the sharp beady eyes that boded unpleasantness.
Had he telephoned?</p>

<p>“Captain Laroque?” queried the governor.</p>

<p>Drexel put on a formidable look to match his
name, one part brutality to one part swagger.</p>

<p>“At your service, Colonel Kavelin,” he returned,
holding himself ready to make a dash out of the
door. “I suppose you know my business. You
had a message from the administrator of prisons?”</p>

<p>“I had two,” growled the governor.</p>

<p>“Two!” Drexel backed nearer the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, two.”</p>

<p>“The second—when did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“You—you called him up?”</p>

<p>“No. He called me up.”</p>

<p>Drexel caught at hope. “What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said to tell you, when you had finished, to
come back to him.”</p>

<p>Sabatoff!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“The transfer of these prisoners may seem all right
to him,” the governor went on, suddenly flaring into
anger. “But to remove them on the very first day
I am in charge, it is an insult—it is casting doubt
on my watchfulness and trustworthiness.”</p>

<p>So that was the meaning of the governor’s black
manner! He had been pricked in his professional
pride, and since he dared not vent his spleen on those
above he was venting it on their agent.</p>

<p>“Come, colonel,” said Drexel soothingly. “I
understand. I am more sorry than you that it is
necessary for me to be here on this errand. Can
I say more?”</p>

<p>The scowl slowly lifted from the governor’s face.
“Pardon me, captain. I should have remembered
that we are both mere order-obeying machines.”
He held out his hand. “We might as well be friends.
I’ve heard much of you, Captain Laroque, and it’s
a pleasure to meet you.”</p>

<p>Drexel took the hand. “Thank you, colonel.”</p>

<p>“Though at least they might have notified me
sooner,” grumbled the governor. “The executions
are all arranged for—the orders all given—the men
appointed to the work merely waiting for the hour.
But that’s no fault of yours, captain!” He proffered
his cigarette case. “Will you join me?”</p>

<p>“If you please. Thank you. And now I suppose
the prisoners are ready?”</p>

<p>“They have merely to be brought from their
cells. Will you let me have the order?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Drexel handed it forth, and life stood suspended
in him while it underwent the scrutiny of the governor’s
sharp eyes. If Sabatoff had made an error
in the form!</p>

<p>But the governor thrust it into a drawer of his
desk. “So you only want four of them?”</p>

<p>“Four, yes. The prisoners known as Borodin,
Sonya Varanova, Razoff and The White One.”</p>

<p>“They trust me with one out of the five; I dare
say I should be satisfied,” said the governor ironically.
“The order against the fifth, of course, still
stands. I suppose you will wait here while I bring
them.”</p>

<p>It flashed upon Drexel that if Sonya first saw him
in this bright room, her natural astonishment might
be observed and prove the means of their betrayal.
Better that the first meeting should be in her shadowy
cell.</p>

<p>“No, I will go with you,” he said.</p>

<p>The governor summoned guards and ordered
irons for four and a wheeled chair for The White
One; then armed with a lantern he led the way
from the office. A deeper chill, a more fearsome
suspense, settled upon Drexel as he entered the cold
and gloomy corridors whence no voice could penetrate
the outer world—behind whose every door
lay some political dreamer who perhaps would
never again look upon the sun. Through one dark
corridor—then another—then another, the governor
and Drexel marched, followed by a guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
with manacles and leg-chains, and another trundling
The White One’s chair.</p>

<p>At length the governor paused and thrust a key
into a door. “In here is the old woman,” he said.</p>

<p>They entered. The lantern’s yellow light revealed
The White One upon the straw mattress of an iron
cot. She turned her white head and regarded the
invaders with calm questioning.</p>

<p>The governor stepped forward, the guard with
the irons beside him. “Hold out your hands!”
he ordered.</p>

<p>“What for?” she asked in her even voice.</p>

<p>“For those,” and he pointed to the heavy manacles
in the hands of the guard.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>“None of your questions! Out with your hands!”</p>

<p>She returned his look with the calm defiance of
her unbroken spirit. “I shall give you no aid in
leading me to a fate I am ignorant of.”</p>

<p>“You won’t!” roared the governor.</p>

<p>He snatched the manacles from the guard, tore off
her coarse blanket and was reaching for her wrists,
when Drexel quickly shouldered in front of him.</p>

<p>“Wait, colonel. I’ll make her obey!”</p>

<p>He seized the lantern and held it before him, so
standing that his body blocked the governor’s sight
of the blanched head on the pillow.</p>

<p>“You hear me—hold out your hands!” he
commanded in a voice that would have been a credit
to Captain Laroque himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>She gazed up at him with her calm defiance;
then the lips slowly parted, and a dazed, marvelling
look came into the gray old eyes. Then her face
was as calm as before.</p>

<p>Slowly she stretched out her thin white wrists.</p>

<p>Her legs were not put in chains. They were
already sufficiently shackled by disease. With a
show of roughness, but with infinite care, Drexel
lifted the frail figure from the bed and placed it in
the chair. Then he wheeled her into the corridor.</p>

<p>The dungeon of Razoff was next entered. To
him, too, Drexel covertly revealed himself; and a
few minutes later, irons on hands and feet, he was
waiting in the corridor beside The White One.</p>

<p>Thus far all had gone with the smoothness of a
wish. The governor now unlocked a third door.
“Here are the condemned ones—all together,”
said he.</p>

<p>They entered, followed by the guards. In the
days before the Fortress had become a political
prison, this gloomy dungeon had been a casemate,
and the one window through the five feet of solid
masonry had been the embrasure through which
had looked forth the muzzle of a great cannon.
Beneath the window, on the bed, her brother’s arm
about her, sat Sonya. Drexel’s heart gave a leap.
His feverish gaze saw naught but her.</p>

<p>“Get ready there!” ordered the governor.</p>

<p>From out a shadowy corner sprang a third figure.
“You’ve come at last! I’m ready!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>Drexel’s breath suddenly stopped. His blood
seemed all to leave him, and he seemed to turn to
ice.</p>

<p>“I’m ready! Come on!” cried Freeman eagerly.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you be afraid I’ll overlook you,”
the governor grimly reassured him. “But I don’t
want you yet.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Freeman. “Hasn’t the order for
my release from prison come yet?”</p>

<p>“The order that is going to release you from
prison and everything else—yes.”</p>

<p>“But my pardon? My reprieve?” Freeman
took a quick step forward and pointed a finger at
Drexel. “Are you sure he hasn’t got it?”</p>

<p>“No. Be quiet, will you!” and the governor
gave him a push.</p>

<p>Sonya had been looking at Freeman in questioning
surprise. “The order for your release?” she now
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, we all entertain hope to the last,” he said,
and retreated into his corner.</p>

<p>Drexel took breath and hope into himself. If
he kept silent, if he kept in the shadow, he might
go unrecognized by Freeman and there might yet
be a chance. He guessed Freeman’s reason for
being here, but he saw the governor was not a
confidant of the plan.</p>

<p>Colonel Kavelin turned to the gray-garbed
brother and sister. “You two are the ones I
want.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Our execution was set for four,” said Borodin.
“Is not our life short enough, without your stealing
an hour from it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Sonya, “that the gallows grows
impatient.”</p>

<p>Many a jailer, less hardened than Colonel Kavelin,
finds a perverted gratification in delaying to give
relieving news to a prisoner—there is a rarely exquisite
pleasure in watching the poor thing writhe a
little longer. Colonel Kavelin did not deign to set
the brother and sister right, and Drexel did not dare
to, for the statement that they were to be removed,
not executed, would be certain to rouse Freeman’s
deadly suspicion.</p>

<p>“Let’s have those irons,” said the governor to
the guard. Then he looked back at Drexel who had
shrunk into the shadow near the door. “These
prisoners are inclined to make trouble, Captain
Laroque. To save time and a row, we’ll just put
the irons on them ourselves. I’ll attend to the man.
Women seem your specialty, so I turn her over to
you.”</p>

<p>Drexel could but obey. He pushed his cap far
down, and praying that the dusk of the dungeon
might be a mask to him against the eyes of Freeman,
he took a set of the irons and moved forward to
Sonya. She met him with a gaze of magnificent
wrath and contempt.</p>

<p>“Is it not enough that you should hang us,” she
demanded, “without hanging us in chains?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>“We’ll hang you as we please, my lady,” Drexel
roughly responded.</p>

<p>“Spoken like the infamous Captain Laroque!”
she flamed back at him.</p>

<p>“That kind of talk will make it all the worse for
you,” he growled. He knelt down, the leg-irons in
his hands. “Put out your foot!”</p>

<p>“I will not!”</p>

<p>“Put out your foot, I say!”</p>

<p>“I will never submit to chains!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste words on her—use force,” advised
the governor, who with the aid of a guard was
practising this expedient on Borodin. “Or wait
a minute, and I will help you.”</p>

<p>“I can manage her,” Drexel quickly returned.</p>

<p>But how he had no idea. Oh, this delay!—with
destruction watching from Freeman’s corner. If
she only knew!</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought of something she had taught
him one day in the house in Three Saints’ Court—the
telegraph code of political prisoners, by means
of which they speak among themselves by dot-and-dash
raps upon their dungeon walls. Sonya’s back
was to Freeman; the governor was bent over Borodin.
He seized one of her ankles. She did not struggle,
but she grew rigid.</p>

<p>“Oh, you brute!” she breathed hotly.</p>

<p>With quick sharp indentations of his thumb
Drexel spelled his name upon her ankle. He felt
a start go through her. Again he spelled his name;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
then, ordering the guard away and turning his back
to Freeman, he raised his face so that the governor’s
light shone full into it. A quivering tensity told
him that she saw and recognized.</p>

<p>“Put out your foot!” he growled once more.</p>

<p>With the wrathful indignation of one who yields to
brute force, she acceded; and a minute later, with
the same air of outraged pride, she yielded her
wrists to the manacles. He had a momentary
glimpse of her face. It showed nothing of the hope
of life that thrilled her; it showed nothing of her
awed astonishment at his presence. Its control
was perfect.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, captain?” asked the governor.</p>

<p>“All ready, colonel,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>Freeman came out of his corner, and Drexel
matched the movement by slipping toward the door.
“Good-bye, comrades,” said the spy, in the tone of
the last and long farewell.</p>

<p>Brother and sister clasped the false hand, then
moved toward the door. Drexel began to breathe
again. Another minute and the cell door would
be between him and Freeman.</p>

<p>The spy twitched the governor’s sleeve. “Colonel,”
he said in a low, eager voice, “my pardon will
certainly be in your office—”</p>

<p>The governor shook him off with an oath and
turned his back upon him. Then, obeying his
instinctive care, he examined first the irons on
Sonya’s ankles then those upon her wrists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“Well, Captain Laroque,” he remarked with
satisfaction, “I guess they’ll give you no trouble
on the journey.”</p>

<p>“Journey?” said Borodin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the governor coolly. “Didn’t I tell
you you were being removed to Schlusselburg?”</p>

<p>“Schlusselburg!” exclaimed Borodin.</p>

<p>“Schlusselburg!” exclaimed Freeman, springing
forward.</p>

<p>The life went out of Drexel.</p>

<p>“You’re removing them to Schlusselburg?” Freeman
demanded fiercely. “By whose order?”</p>

<p>The governor answered with a curse and with
a drive of his fist into Freeman’s chest. Freeman
came back from the blow in a fury.</p>

<p>“You’ll pay for that, Colonel Kavelin!” He
turned to Drexel. “You’re taking them? Who
are you?”</p>

<p>He jerked the lantern from the governor and
swung it into Drexel’s white face. He stared.
Then his swollen, discoloured countenance gleamed
with triumph.</p>

<p>“This is no Captain Laroque!” his voice rang
out. “He is a revolutionist! And this is no removal
of prisoners to Schlusselburg! It’s a plot to set
them free!”</p>

<p>The governor, Borodin and Sonya gazed at Freeman,
each amazed in a different way. Drexel
seemed to be whirling downward into abysmal
depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“I denounce this as a plot!” Freeman cried on.
“And this Captain Laroque is himself wanted by
the police!” His face gleamed into Drexel’s.
“Captain,” he exulted, “I think this puts us even!”</p>

<p>Drexel had not a word.</p>

<p>The governor looked at Drexel with suspicion.
“What does this mean, captain?”</p>

<p>Drexel desperately took his nerves in both his
hands and summoned all his boldness. “I was
going to ask you the same question, colonel,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Most noteworthy acting, captain,” put in Freeman
sardonically. “But even such rare acting
won’t save you now!”</p>

<p>“I find,” Drexel continued to the governor, in
a tone of cool comment, “that condemned revolutionists
frequently lose their nerve at the last moment
and go out of their head.”</p>

<p>“I’m no revolutionist, Colonel Kavelin,” Freeman
retorted. “I’m a secret agent of the political police.
I’m the man that laid bare this whole plot. And
with this Captain Laroque, you’ve got them all!”</p>

<p>The governor wavered. Drexel saw it. He gave
Freeman a black look—a Captain Laroque look.
“You dog! Be careful, or you’ll go too far!” he
warned.</p>

<p>He turned to the governor. “Colonel,” he said,
to recall to the governor his credentials, “to stop
the ravings of this crazed prisoner you might tell
him that you have had two messages from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
administrator of prisons about this matter, in
addition to the official order for the removal.”</p>

<p>“Tricks! Forgery!” said Freeman contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I have found, and doubtless so have you,
colonel,” Drexel went on coolly, “that an unnerved
prisoner like this, with the fear of the gallows upon
him, will make any frantic pretense, that he’s a spy,
or what-not, in the hope of thereby gaining a little
delay in his execution. At first, you remember,
his pretense was that a reprieve was coming.”</p>

<p>Drexel’s eyes had never left the governor’s face,
that barometer of his fate; and during his last words
he saw it began to glower at Freeman.</p>

<p>“Enough of this fooling, colonel,” said he in his
harshest Captain Laroque voice, giving Freeman
his darkest look. “It is not my custom to waste
time on these dogs of prisoners!”</p>

<p>“Nor mine!” said the governor. “I’m too old a
bird to be fooled by such tricks.”</p>

<p>“What! You don’t believe me?” cried Freeman.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe you! And be quiet, if you
want an unbroken head!” The governor started out
the door. “Come on, Captain Laroque.”</p>

<p>“But, colonel, stop, stop!” Freeman cried with
frantic energy. “I tell you this is a trick—a plot!
He’s going to set those prisoners free! Remember,
I give you warning!”</p>

<p>“And I’ve given you warning!” returned the
governor wrathfully, and drove his heavy fist into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
Freeman’s face. The spy reeled back, then rushed
forward with a wild look of evil in his eyes. “Seize
him!” the governor sharply ordered the guards.
They pinioned Freeman in their arms. “Hold him
till we get out of here. I’ll come back and let you
out later.”</p>

<p>They passed out of the dungeon, Drexel last. He
glanced back. The guards were too occupied by
their writhing prisoner to notice, but he caught
Freeman’s eyes. He flashed him an instant-long
look of triumph.</p>

<p>“Since you claim acquaintance with me,” he said,
“I wish you good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Curse you!” grated out Freeman. “And curse
that idiot governor! But in five minutes I’ll be out
of here—”</p>

<p>But the closing of the door cut off his sentence in
the middle.</p>

<p>The governor led the way, Drexel brought up the
rear, pushing The White One’s chair, and between
them Borodin, Razoff and Sonya shuffled with
short, clanking steps. Once The White One turned
her head and gave him an upward look—a look that
might have been a warrior angel’s benediction.
And once Sonya stole him back a look—and ah, such
a look as it was!... Fresh spirit flamed into him.</p>

<p>They moved in clanking processional back through
dungeon-bordered corridors—every step a step
nearer freedom; and came at last to the governor’s
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“I hope there will be no further delay,” said
Drexel.</p>

<p>“None at all,” said the governor. “I have the
receipt for the prisoners all ready for your signature.
That formality done with and you are free.”</p>

<p>They entered the office. A man who sat at the
governor’s desk turned them a casual look. Then
he slowly rose to his feet and stared.</p>

<p>It was Prince Berloff.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>THE GODDESS OF VENGEANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE prince stared about at the transfixed
party. In all his life he had never been
more astounded. But after the first
moment he had his astonishment under perfect
control. He realized that he was master of the
situation, and that the situation, near as it had been
to spoiling all, fitted his desire as though framed by
his private deity.</p>

<p>The governor had addressed him with obsequious
pleasure and surprise, but him the prince had at
first not heeded. But now he turned to him.</p>

<p>“Colonel Kavelin, would you mind explaining
the meaning of this,” he said in his even voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Your Excellency. Captain Laroque
here is removing these prisoners to Schlusselburg.
Here is the order,” and he took it from his desk.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I do not care to see it.”</p>

<p>He turned to Drexel. “And so, Captain Laroque,”
he said, with a glint of a white, sardonic smile,
“you are removing these people to Schlusselburg.”</p>

<p>Drexel had run the whole gamut of emotions that
night. There was no new dismay, no deeper fear,
for him to feel. He had done his best, but fate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
had been against him from the first and the game
was up; and there was nothing for it now but to
meet the end as boldly as he could. He did not
answer the prince, but he met his look calmly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are not aware, Colonel Kavelin,”
the prince continued in his even, conversational
tone, “that your Captain Laroque is no captain at
all, but a revolutionist.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the governor.</p>

<p>“I recognize him as a leader who is wanted by
the police, and I charge you to seize him.”</p>

<p>The governor turned on Drexel in a fury. “So
you have been trying to fool me!” he roared.</p>

<p>“I have done my best,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“And this Schlusselburg business is just a plot
to free these prisoners?”</p>

<p>“You are quite correct.”</p>

<p>“Then that prisoner was right!” ejaculated the
governor. “Perhaps after all he is a spy, and there
is to be an order for his release!”</p>

<p>“There is an order,” said the prince, “for I am
here to bring it.”</p>

<p>“My God—and I all but set them free!” The
governor blanched at his narrow escape. Then his
fury blazed forth again. “Back you all four go
to your cells!—and you two straight from your
cell to your scaffold! And as for you, Captain
Laroque”—he almost frothed in his revengeful
rage—“you’ll never leave here to trick another
man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>He tore Drexel’s revolver from its holster, and
with a quick stride toward his desk raised a hand
above a bronze bell to sound the guard-summoning
alarm. But though Drexel had thought all hope
was gone, there was an instinct in him, deeper than
consciousness, not to give up. He sprang desperately
forward and caught the descending arm. At the
same moment, as though this had been a signal,
Razoff and Borodin seized Berloff in their manacled
hands.</p>

<p>Like a flash Drexel’s other hand went for the
governor’s throat to shut off the alarm from that,
and he swung him out of reach of the bell. But
the governor seized from the desk the big knife
with which he had been making erasures and drove
it into Drexel’s shoulder. He jerked it out and
raised it for a second plunge. Drexel released the
throat to check this nearer death. He seized the
governor’s wrist, and in the same instant sent his
fist into the governor’s great stomach; the wind
rushed groaning out of his mouth and his arms fell
to his sides. Drexel drove his fist fiercely into the
bushy beard. The governor went reeling, and even
as he fell Drexel drove his fist with terrific force a
second time against his chin. The governor lay
motionless.</p>

<p>Drexel whirled about for Berloff. For the minute
of his struggle with the governor Borodin and Razoff
had managed to hold the prince, but the handicap
of manacles and anklets was too great, and the instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
the governor fell the prince broke from their grasp.
So when Drexel turned it was to find himself looking
at the cold barrel of a pistol, and behind that the
cold face of Berloff.</p>

<p>“I owe you great thanks, Captain Laroque, for
removing the governor as a spectator,” he said, his
eyes agleam with triumph. “That sets me free to
admit the fact of our acquaintance and to enjoy
this little reunion openly. For there is no danger”—he
smiled about on them in malign pleasantry—“when
all the present witnesses will soon be as
insensible as our friend the governor there, only
permanently so.”</p>

<p>White as she was, Sonya went a shade paler.
She came forward with short, clanking steps.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Prince Berloff, that you intend
executing not only us Russians, but Mr. Drexel as
well?”</p>

<p>“Duty is duty, my dear cousin”—he bowed to
her—“however unpleasant.”</p>

<p>She would have spoken in Drexel’s behalf, but
he stopped her. “I would not plead with him for
your life, for I know it would be useless. It is just
as vain to plead for mine.”</p>

<p>He turned to Berloff. “We want none of your
devil’s raillery! You have won. Go on with your
purpose!”</p>

<p>“As you command. But remember that the haste
in the matter is yours, not mine.” He crossed to the
desk and stood beside the bell. “But before I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
call in those outsiders, the guards, let us have our
farewell among ourselves.”</p>

<p>He turned to The White One, who sat three or
four paces behind him, her manacled hands upon
her knees. “So you are the famous White One.
I am glad to meet you, madame, and I beg to assure
you that the meeting with The White One will be
all the more memorable to me since it took place
on what afterward proved the last day of her
memorable life.”</p>

<p>That high, pale face returned his mocking courtesy
with a gaze of blazing hatred.</p>

<p>“Justice will not always withhold its hands from
you,” she said. “This is the hour of your triumph—but
that hour may not be for long!”</p>

<p>“Pardon my saying it, madame,” returned he,
“but one so near the end should cherish kindlier
thoughts.”</p>

<p>For all his air of free and easy mastery he was
keeping his eye on the others to check any dangerous
move. But this helpless invalid needed no watching,
and he turned his back upon her, and gazed at Sonya
and Borodin.</p>

<p>“As for you, my dear cousins, it would be hypocrisy
for your heir to make pretense of grief. So
what more can I say than ‘I thank you.’”</p>

<p>“Ring the bell!” returned Sonya.</p>

<p>“In one moment I must, for see, the governor is
returning to life to intrude upon our pleasant function.”
He turned to Drexel. “So I make haste,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
my dear cousin-never-to-be, to wish that your taking-off
may be as gentle as falling asleep, and that
your waking may be among the angels!”</p>

<p>Drexel kept contemptuous silence.</p>

<p>The prince flashed upon them all a look of mocking,
malignant triumph—a figure electric with
power, coldly, cruelly handsome—a model of
puissant, high-bred deviltry, fit for the emulation of
the first gentleman of hell.</p>

<p>“And now before the guards come in I will say
good-bye to you all”—he bowed around—“and
may your journey be pleasant!”</p>

<p>He raised his hand for the stroke upon the bell, and
held it aloft in fiendish pleasure of prolonging their
suspense; and for a moment he stood there poised
in his triumph. They stared at him, waiting breathless
for the fatal hand to fall.</p>

<p>Then their eyes widened, their lips parted, and in
thrilled awe they stared beyond to the wheeled chair at
his back, where sat the unfeared invalid. For something
strange was happening with The White One.
That snow-haired figure was slowly uprearing itself,
whom none here had ever seen upon her feet before.</p>

<p>She was of commanding height. In her thin
face there blazed a stern fire; and this portentous look,
her loose white hair, her priestess stature, the flowing
robe in which they had garbed her, made her a figure
of preternatural majesty. She moved three silent
paces to the prince’s back, above whom she towered,
and there she paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>The prince was bowing in mockery and saying
with his sardonic smile: “And now once more,
good-bye!”</p>

<p>He never knew the reflex meaning of his words.
The tall figure at his back raised her thin arms on
high, pressing together the heavy manacles that
bound her wrists. And then, her physician’s eye
fixed on a vital spot, all her strength summoned up
in this one effort, she swung that improvised sledge
downward upon his head.</p>

<p>He fell without a word, his sneering good-bye
still warm upon his lips.</p>

<p>She gazed down at his lifeless body, in her blazing,
majestic wrath looking the very high priestess of
vengeance. She said never a word. For a moment
she stood so, eyes flashing, breast heaving, erect
in her magnificent frailty. Then she raised her
eyes to the others and parted her lips as if to speak.
But the fire faded from her face—a tremor went
through her old body—she wavered—and her
figure bowed over and toppled to the floor.</p>

<p>Her fall broke the awed spell which had bound the
little group. Sonya sprang to her side and turned
her upon her back. A glance at that calm face
was enough. But Sonya pressed her ear against
where had beat The White One’s heart.</p>

<p>“Dead!” she whispered.</p>

<p>And so it was. The supreme excitation of her
mighty wrath had for the moment conquered
disease and lent strength to her withered limbs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
She had made the effort her doctor had long foretold
as fatal, had spent her little store of strength in one
prodigal blow; and, her spasm of energy over,
her heart had instantly exacted the penalty—and
there she lay!</p>

<p>But there was no time to exclaim upon the swift
happenings of this one minute. A shuffling noise
from behind them caused Drexel to turn quickly.
The governor had risen upon one knee and was
stretching out a hand toward the bell. At once
Drexel was upon him, and a minute later he was
securely bound and a gag was in his throat.</p>

<p>The way was now clear for their escape; but to
leave these bodies here for the next minute’s possible
discovery might mean alarm and pursuit before
they were out of the Fortress gates. Opening into
the office was a store-room in which were kept blank
documents and other office supplies. In this Drexel
laid with reverence the wasted body of The White
One; it seemed hardly less than sacrilege to
desert those warrior ashes to the enemy, but there
remained no other way. And in here he dragged
her chair, and the bulky person of the governor,
glowering impotently; and last of all the prince,
troubled no more with dreams of empire.</p>

<p>Three minutes later the prison van, with prisoners
and guards inside it and Drexel driving at its tail,
moved with official staidness through the arched
gateway of the Fortress, out into the vast black
silence of the night.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>THE DAY AFTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AN HOUR would likely pass—with God’s
grace more—ere the tenants of that dark
room would be discovered and St. Petersburg’s
ten thousand police and spies be unloosed
upon the chase. By the hour’s end they must all
be safe in hiding, or stand in danger of wearing
the Czar’s neckties.</p>

<p>Drexel had still urgent need of his wits. But
as the grim shape of the Fortress withdrew into the
rearward gloom, the breaking strain of the last
half-hour began to relax, and he began to feel the
reaction of the two nights he had not slept, and of
the two nights and a day that he had been stretched
upon the rack of an almost superhuman suspense.
Moreover, the gash from the governor’s knife, mere
flesh-wound though it was, had bled profusely in
the office, and now in the sleigh he could feel the
warm blood creeping down his back and chest.
He was dizzy, and he felt himself grow weaker, yet
he dared not call anyone from the van to bear him
company, for the minutes were too precious to use
a single one of them in a transfer to the sleigh.</p>

<p>He clenched his teeth and tried to hold fast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
his slipping strength. But he grew more dizzy,
more weak. His horse, noting the lack of incitement
from behind, dropped into a lazy jog, and
Drexel saw the van pull rapidly away. He had
not the strength to mend the horse’s pace, nor the
strength to call out, even had he dared. The gap
widened; the van was lost in the darkness ahead;
he felt his strength ebbing—ebbing. He made a
supreme effort to hold on to consciousness; but
suddenly blankness closed in upon him, and he
lurched sidewise from the low sleigh out upon the
snow.</p>

<p>His next sensation was of some one shaking his
shoulder. He opened his eyes. It was still night;
he was sitting on the snow; and at his back was a
support which he realized was a man’s knee.</p>

<p>“Awake yet?” asked a voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said weakly. “What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Five.”</p>

<p>He had lain there for an hour or more. Where
were Sonya and the others?</p>

<p>He started to rise, and the man put his hand
beneath his shoulders and assisted him to his feet.
Drexel now made out that his Good Samaritan wore
the uniform of a policeman, and he had a moment
of poignant fear.</p>

<p>“A drop too much, eh?” said the officer with
heavy facetiousness.</p>

<p>Drexel was more than content to have that remain
the explanation of his state. He was still weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
and there was an icy numbness through all his bones.
He begged the use of the policeman’s arm for a little
way, which was granted him; and after a few blocks
of that support he felt sufficiently recovered to
thank his obliging crutch and venture on alone.</p>

<p>At last he gained the house of Sabatoff. The
Keeper of the Seals listened in amazement to his
sketch of what had happened in the three hours
since they had parted; and on learning of the governor’s
knife he quickly bared Drexel’s shoulder
and dressed the wound with no little skill.</p>

<p>Whether the prisoners had escaped or been recaptured,
it was clear that Drexel could do no more
and that it was time for him to consider his own
safety. Sabatoff aided him to change into the
clothes of a citizen, and once more he set forth
from the little house, Sabatoff promising to send
news of the fugitives if any came to him. An hour
later, having changed from sleigh to sleigh to hide
his trail, he drove up to the Hotel Europe. A sense
of personal relief descended upon him as he entered
the hotel. He was once more Henry Drexel, American
citizen.</p>

<p>It was too early yet to see his uncle’s family, so
he went to his room and stretched himself upon his
bed. But weary as he was, there was no sleep for
him. Was Sonya now in safety—or had she been
recaptured in the hour of escape and was she now
lying again in her dungeon in Peter and Paul?</p>

<p>This uncertainty throbbed through him with every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
pulse-beat. And there was no active measure he
could take to learn the truth. He could do nothing
but wait; wait for good or evil news from Sabatoff,
or wait till rumour or the papers brought him news
that could be only of disaster.</p>

<p>His mind went back to that strange introduction
to Sonya upon the Moscow train. Half his life
seemed to have been lived since then—and yet
this epoch included but a fortnight! She passed
before him in the various aspects which the two
weeks had shown him; as the shawled factory girl;
as the princess, proud with the pride of a thousand
years; as the ardent saviour of her brother’s life;
he saw her go calmly down the stairs of the house in
Three Saints’ Court to give him chance of escape;
saw her in her dungeon, with calm and lofty mien
prepared to mount the sacrificial scaffold. And
this rare figure, while the smoke had swirled and
the flames had flared wildly round them, this rare
figure had kissed his brow, and said she loved him!
The remembrance of that moment swept him in
dizzy awe to heaven....</p>

<p>But where was she now?</p>

<p>He could stand this inactive ignorance no longer.
He got into a suit of his own clothes and went down
to the dining-room. Perhaps news might already
be circulating there, for the Hotel Europe was a
favourite resort of officialdom. With swift sight
he picked out three officers whose breakfast of tea
and sweet rolls was forgotten in excited converse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
Masking any possible show of emotion behind the
Paris Herald, he took the table adjoining them, his
ears wide open. Sure enough, they were rehearsing
last night’s events in Peter and Paul. It appeared
that Governor Kavelin had been discovered and
released at five o’clock and all St. Petersburg was
now beginning to reverberate with the affair. They
had the whole story, even the awesome picture of
the fall of Prince Berloff beneath the manacles of
The White One, followed by her own swift death—for
Colonel Kavelin had been far enough revived
to be a witness to the double tragedy.</p>

<p>It was all strange, they said—wonderfully,
wonderfully strange. And not the least strange
of all was a later episode. There had been a third
condemned prisoner, the American correspondent,
James Freeman. When the guards had come at
four o’clock to lead him to his execution, he had
protested that he was no revolutionist, but a spy, and
his being there was but a spy’s stratagem, and that
an order for his release was on the way and should
have been there an hour gone. They had regarded
the talk as the hysterical ravings of one undone by
fear, and had dragged him from his cell. When he
had seen there was no hope, he had taken on a cynical
courage. He had ordered the hangman to keep
his greasy paws off him, and had himself, with steady
hands, settled the soaped cord about his neck, and
with a nod and a sneering, “Good-morning, gentlemen,”
had swung out of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>And an hour later the order for his release had
been found in the breast of the dead Berloff!</p>

<p>While Drexel listened, his eyes fixed on his paper,
there was a rustle beside him. He looked up.
Into the empty chair across the table had slipped
the Countess Baronova.</p>

<p>Her manner was smilingly composed. But he
saw that she was pale, high-wrought, and that there
were dark rings about her eyes.</p>

<p>She leaned forward. “I have come here—especially
to try to see you,” she whispered with an
effort.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You know—what I have been. From your
point of view—and I do not blame you—it is
your duty to expose me to the revolutionists. I
have come to tell you that this is not necessary.”</p>

<p>He did not reply.</p>

<p>“After what has happened—the last few days—last
night—I cannot be what I used to be any
more. I wanted you to know that.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I am leaving Russia. After what has happened—I
can’t stand it here—and it will be safest. I
think that is all. Except”—and she looked him
straight in the eyes, and her voice dropped to a
barest breath—“I believe I know who this Captain
Laroque is.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“What he did was—was wonderful!” Her dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
eyes looked a quick, subdued admiration. “That
is all. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She rose and was leaving him, but he followed
her to the tapestried doorway. Here, very pale, she
inclined her head to him and was sweeping away—when
suddenly he held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said. “And I hope—I hope—”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>For an instant her hand pressed his with quivering
tensity. Then she bowed again, and moved away.</p>

<p>Drexel returned to his table and again set his
ears open, but heard nothing more of consequence.
He thought of his relatives above; of Alice, even
now, perhaps, beginning excitedly to prepare for
the wedding. He was rising to go upstairs and
discharge his painful duty, when he saw that Prince
Valenko had entered the room and was bearing in
his direction. They exchanged a few words of commonplace,
then they drew apart to a window and
made a show of gazing out.</p>

<p>The prince’s manner was cool, even casual, for
the sake of those eyes that might be looking on, and
in it was no slightest sign of the secret that lay between
them. But when he spoke, his low words vibrated
with eagerness.</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything of the escaped prisoners?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing. And you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Until certain gentlemen who honoured
me with their company last night left me this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
morning, I had supposed the execution had taken
place.”</p>

<p>Drexel replied in the same masked language.
“You must have been surprised.”</p>

<p>The prince nodded. “I have no idea who this
Captain Laroque is,” he went on, with a calm
look into Drexel’s face; “and I have no wish to
know, for it would be my official duty to hang him.
But if by any strange twist of circumstances you
should ever meet him, please inform him that he
is the boldest man I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“Should there be such a strange twist, I will,”
said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Doubtless he is already on his way out of Russia,”
the prince went on. “For he undoubtedly knows
that of all concerned in last night’s affair he is
the one most wanted by the Government—that a
vast reward is being offered for his arrest, and that
thousands of men are already searching for him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” ejaculated Drexel.</p>

<p>“But I dare say he will make good his escape.
Should he by chance have any relatives of importance—bereaved
relatives—in whose company he could
go, he would be certain to escape suspicion.” He
bowed. “I wish you good-morning, Mr. Drexel.”</p>

<p>He started away. But with a quick motion Drexel
caught his arm, for through the doorway had just
entered Captain Nadson and Colonel Kavelin.</p>

<p>“Prince,” he whispered, “see those two men
who have just entered. I prefer not to meet them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>The prince looked. “Excuse me,” he said.
“Those are the men who can identify Captain Laroque.
I have some orders to give them.”</p>

<p>Out of the tail of his eye Drexel saw the military
governor accost the two officers with curt aloofness
and lead them out. He waited a moment, then
crossed to the door. The trio were in conversation
down a corridor, the backs of the two officers toward
him. Drexel crossed to the stairway and swiftly
mounted.</p>

<p>Of a surety, St. Petersburg was no safe place for
him!</p>

<p>He went to his uncle’s apartment. Tables and
chairs were heaped with wedding gifts, and wherever
a spot was empty of presents it held a vase of flowers.
The Howards had been up most of the night before,
and his aunt and Alice were only rising, but his
uncle joined him at once. The old man greeted
him heartily, and spoke for several minutes of the
wedding now but a few hours off.</p>

<p>“And was your trip to Moscow a success?”</p>

<p>“I hope events will prove that I have succeeded
in every detail,” said Drexel.</p>

<p>“Good. You’ll tell me about it later. And I’ve
been having success too.” He half closed his eyes
and nodded his head. “I’ve had a dozen cipher
cables from America while you’ve been gone. Great
news about that street-railway scheme!”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Drexel mechanically. He was glad
of a momentary respite from his unpleasant task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“Things have developed just as we planned.
The scheme is ripe. All we’ve got to do is to hustle
home, do a little more work, and then pluck the
profits.”</p>

<p>The scheme had been out of Drexel’s head for
near a fortnight. Coming back fresh as it did, it
had certain aspects it had not borne before.</p>

<p>“I believe the fifteen millions profit is to be
squeezed out of the city—out of the people,” he
said slowly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t use such an unpleasant word as
‘squeeze’ about money that I was to control,”
returned his uncle dryly. “Remember, this is
where I step out and you step in. ‘The king is
dead; long live the king!’”</p>

<p>Drexel gazed steadily at the carpet.</p>

<p>“You seem to take your coronation very coolly,”
grumbled his uncle. “But in two weeks you’ll
be back in Chicago, in the midst of the deal. You’ll
be excited enough then!”</p>

<p>Drexel still looked down. His thoughts had
gone to Sonya—to Sonya and the others, giving
their all to the people’s cause. He raised his
eyes.</p>

<p>“And what about the people?” he slowly asked.</p>

<p>“The people?” queried his uncle. “What
people?”</p>

<p>“The city—the stock-holders—the tax-payers—the
passengers—all the people we’re going to
get the fifteen millions out of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“Now what the devil’s the matter with the boy!”
exploded the old man.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been doing any thinking, and I’m not
going to do any moralizing now—but somehow
that deal looks different to me from what it used to.”
He was silent a moment. “I’m sorry to disappoint
you, uncle, but you’ll have to count me out.”</p>

<p>“Count you out!” He stared. “Are you
crazy?”</p>

<p>“I am just beginning to come to my senses,” said
Drexel.</p>

<p>“Then you are in earnest?”</p>

<p>“With all the earnestness I have.”</p>

<p>The old man regarded the other in grim silence.
His jaw began to tighten and his eyes to shoot fire
from beneath their bushy iron-gray brows.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Some quality that had lain dormant in Drexel
till it had been roused by his fortnight’s contact with
new ideals, new motives, now suddenly stirred
within him. His face quickened with decision.</p>

<p>“Yes I think I do know,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well—what is it?”</p>

<p>“After all, I’m not going to drop out of that
street-car deal. I’m going back to fight it.”</p>

<p>“Fight it?” The old man looked bewildered.
“For whom?”</p>

<p>“For the people.”</p>

<p>“For the people!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>Amazement, contempt, rising wrath, struggled in
his face. “You realize, young man, that means
you are going to fight me?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, uncle, for I think we have truly
loved one another—”</p>

<p>“No snuffling!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going to fight you.”</p>

<p>The old man stared as if he could not quite believe
his ears; but the square-chinned, determined young
face left him no doubt. His lips tightened into a
hard straight line, his head sank crouching between
his shoulders, his short hair seemed to rise like the
ruff of an angry dog. He leaned forward—the
fighting John Howard that many a man in Chicago
had met and gone down before.</p>

<p>“A declaration of war, eh?” he said in a slow
guttural voice. “All right. I thought I was done
for, but that puts ten more good years in me. And
I think John Howard can give you all you want.
Oh, it’ll be a fight, young man, a fight—and you’ll
never imagine it’s anything else! And now, good-morning
to you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is only natural for you to take it
so, uncle. I’m sorry the break——”</p>

<p>“I think I said good-morning!”</p>

<p>Drexel gazed a moment at the glaring, rigid old
man. “Good-morning,” he said, and started for
the door.</p>

<p>But he turned about. “Pardon me. I have
something of importance to tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“You’ve told me enough!” He pointed to the
door.</p>

<p>“This does not concern me. It concerns you and
aunt, and Alice most of all. I must speak to the
three of you.”</p>

<p>It was the look in Drexel’s face rather than his
words that made his uncle summon Alice and her
mother. Their exclamations of pleasure at sight
of Drexel were stopped by an abrupt command.</p>

<p>“We are no longer friends,” the old man explained
to the wondering women. “Go on, Henry.”</p>

<p>“What I’m going to tell you is God’s truth—I
can prove it all if need be,” he began. And he
went on to unfold the prince’s secret office and
his crafty villainies. Before he was half to the
end of the dark record, his uncle and his aunt were
staring with white faces and Alice was bowed upon
the table among the wedding gifts, sobbing and
shuddering.</p>

<p>When he finished, Alice threw herself upon her
father’s breast. “Oh, I can’t marry him—never!
Never!”</p>

<p>The old man strained her to him convulsively.
“There—there, my child! You shall not!”</p>

<p>He looked in accusing wrath at Drexel. “My
God, why did you wait till the very wedding-day
to tell this?” he fiercely demanded.</p>

<p>“This was my first chance.”</p>

<p>“Well—if they were at the very altar we’d
break it off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>“There is no need to break it off,” said Drexel
quietly.</p>

<p>“No need to break it off! Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” they cried in one voice.</p>

<p>They stared at him, blanched, astounded—and
relieved. Drexel went on to tell how the prince had
come by his death, telling it as something he had
overheard in the dining-room, and referring only
in vaguest terms to Captain Laroque. Some day
he might make known his part in this daring escape,
with its triple tragedy, but that day was in the far,
far future.</p>

<p>Alice again threw herself upon her father’s breast.
“Take me home, father—please, please!” she
begged him.</p>

<p>He caressed her hair with tender hand. “You
shall go. We will leave at once—to-day. But
there’s much to be seen to—packing, tickets, passports,
returning these presents.”</p>

<p>He looked at Drexel, and his face became grim,
but not so grim as it had been a half-hour back.
“Henry, it’s still going to be war all right,” said he.
“But under the circumstances, till we get out of
this country, what do you say to a truce?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart!” said Drexel.</p>

<p>The hours that followed were feverishly busy
ones. Drexel furtively studied Alice. She could
but be appalled by the revelations concerning the
prince and by his death, but in her manner was none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
of that excruciating grief and horror that a loving
heart would feel over such a double loss of a loved
one. It was plain, what he had all along suspected,
that she had never loved Berloff, but that her pretty
young head had merely been turned by his title.
Drexel knew who had most of her heart, and it
needed no superhuman prescience to see her a year
hence, her wounds healed, her head a little
wiser, yielding a blushing “yes” to her old Chicago
lover, Jack Hammond.</p>

<p>But all this while Drexel’s first thoughts were all
of Sonya. Twelve o’clock came—one—two—three—and
not a word of news. Did this silence
mean that she had escaped, but could not without
great risk send him word of her security? Or did
the silence mean that she had been secretly rearrested
and was being secretly held in some
voiceless dungeon?</p>

<p>Every minute repeated these hopes and fears.
He acquiesced in the plan for the general hegira of
that night, let his passport be countersigned, his
baggage be packed, his ticket be bought, for he well
knew the masked advice of General Valenko was good
advice. Yet even as he suffered these preparations,
he knew he would not, could not, leave St. Petersburg
till he had word with Sonya, or knew her fate.</p>

<p>At a little after three Sabatoff called. But he
had not heard a word; and he soon left, to be ready
for a message should one come, with the promise
to return at six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>The early darkness closed down upon the city.
Another hour dragged on. Drexel could stand the
suspense no longer, so, despite the risk, he slipped
down into the tea-room and again set his ears wide
open. They were still discussing the daring of the
unknown Captain Laroque, the escape, the three
tragic deaths. But no word about the prisoners.
He returned above and wore away another awful
hour, and yet another. Then Sabatoff came again—still
with nothing.</p>

<p>Sabatoff had barely gone when a note was handed
Drexel. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am requested to inform you that the condition
of Princess Valenko has shown rapid and great
improvement. Her doctor has given her permission
to receive a few friends, and in case you are at
liberty she will be glad to see you.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Vera Savanova, Nurse.</span>”</p>
</div>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>TO-MORROW?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next fifteen minutes, when Drexel looks
back upon them, present nothing but a
blur of ecstatic relief. Distinct remembrance
begins with his being ushered to a certain
door—a door within which, excited as he was, he
recalled that the princess ten days before had thrown
off her mask to him.</p>

<p>He entered.</p>

<p>There she was!—in a convalescent’s robe, half
reclining in a great chair soft with many cushions.
He could but stare. But a few hours since and he
had seen her in the coarse gray garments of death.
But a few hours—and there she was!</p>

<p>“Close the door, Andrei,” she said.</p>

<p>The door closed.</p>

<p>She rose up in all her superb young beauty and
came to him, her arms outstretched, her face a
glory of love.</p>

<p>“Oh, Henry! Henry!”</p>

<p>“Sonya! My Sonya!”</p>

<p>And he caught her to him.</p>

<p>Ah, that minute against her heart!... It
was payment and more for all his fortnight’s pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
and danger—aye, and payment for the pain and
longing of all the long years to come!</p>

<p>And then she disengaged herself, and took his
pale cheeks in her two hands, and gazed into his
face, her eyes ashine with tears and love and wonder.</p>

<p>“It was brave!—brave!—splendid!” she said
in a trembling whisper. “But I forgot—you are
wounded!”</p>

<p>She led him to a divan before the glowing fire,
and was going on with her praise, but he caught
a hand and pressed it to his heart. “Feel it! Another
word will kill me with happiness. Please don’t,
Sonya!”</p>

<p>He begged her to tell him what had happened
during the day and how she had come home. An
hour after leaving the Fortress, she said, they had
deserted the van and scattered, she going into hiding
in the home of a trusted friend. Here she had lain
all day, not daring to move till she learned how
matters stood. By the coming of dusk her course
was resolved upon. Only three persons, besides her
friends, knew the identity of Sonya Varanova, her
father, Freeman and Prince Berloff. The two last,
in the interest of their crafty scheme, she was certain
had told no one—and now they were dead; her
father she knew she could trust. Dressed as a
working-girl, she had hurried through the disguising
darkness across the city, had watched her chance
and entered the servants’ door unnoticed, had
slipped unseen up to the sick-room where watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
was still being kept—and had become once more
Princess Valenko.</p>

<p>As for the others: the faces of the escort had not
been seen, they could not be identified if caught, and
furthermore they were all as clever at hiding as the
fox. Borodin and Razoff were already on their
way out of Russia, in the guise of immigrants bound
for America—of course, to return in a few weeks
to resume their revolutionary work. They were all
quite safe.</p>

<p>They might be safe, but his concern was not for
them. He looked at that fair dark face, with its
crown of glorious black. Yes, she was again the
princess, but——</p>

<p>“But you are still in danger!” cried he.</p>

<p>“And who in Russia, with a soul, is not?”</p>

<p>“But not such danger as you! You may still be
found out. And then——”</p>

<p>He sickened as he saw her again in last night’s
danger, with this time no rescue for her. “I cannot
bear to think of that!” he cried desperately. “Sonya,
come with me to America!”</p>

<p>“That’s what my heart wants most of all to do,”
said she.</p>

<p>He caught her hands in joy. “Then you will
come?”</p>

<p>Her face grew gray with pain, and she sighed.</p>

<p>“If I only could!”</p>

<p>“You can!”</p>

<p>She slowly shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>“I cannot, dear. If my country were happy, I
would. Ah, but I would! But at the time of my
country’s agony, I cannot think first of my own
happiness. I cannot desert her in the time of her
distress.”</p>

<p>“Then I will stay with you!” he cried. “I’ll
stay with you, and help you!”</p>

<p>“I cannot let you. Father has told me how the
description of Captain Laroque is everywhere. You
are safe for perhaps only a few hours. You must
leave at once.”</p>

<p>He thought a moment. “You are right,” he
said. “And leave for a greater reason than my own
safety. You have an alibi; no one will suspect the
sick Princess Valenko. But should I stay, and
should we be seen together, I the double of Captain
Laroque, you the double of the escaped prisoner—that
would rouse a fatal suspicion. Yes—I must
leave at once.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of your safety alone,” said she.</p>

<p>“But to go away to placid safety, leaving you to
undertake new perils!” he groaned. If at least she
were only safe! He thought of her father, and his
fearing love seized at that hope. “Now that your
father knows, will he not prevent your activities?”</p>

<p>“Father and I have just had a long talk. He
cannot countenance what I do, and I cannot give
up doing it. He cannot denounce me; nor will his
honour let him continue in power and keep silent.
So he is going to resign; he had been considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
that, anyhow, for he is close upon seventy. We
are going to part—to part in love. He is going
to retire to one of his estates.”</p>

<p>“And you,” he cried despairingly, “are going to
plunge into new dangers!”</p>

<p>“Whatever danger my country’s freedom requires—I
must.”</p>

<p>“Sonya! Oh, Sonya!” and her name came out
as a sob.</p>

<p>“But, dear—would you have me suffer these
wrongs in silence?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“I would have my love be safe!” he cried in
anguish.</p>

<p>“Would you have me apathetically content?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, you know, dearest,” he moaned, “that I
would have you be yourself!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew,” she said softly.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in an agony of longing. There
was a sudden flare of hope.</p>

<p>“You said—a moment ago—that if your
country did not need you, you would come to
me.”</p>

<p>“And so I would!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Then if there comes a day when your country
is set free?”</p>

<p>“That day I’ll come to you!” she said.</p>

<p>But hope as suddenly died to ashes. “But
moving among such dangers, you may never see
that day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>“Who knows? Six months—a year—more
perhaps—and then——”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” he whispered, and he tried to close his
eyes against the vision she had conjured up.</p>

<p>“If when you are back in America, you should
hear ... anything, don’t take it with too much
sorrow,” she went on. “Remember that, foreknowing
the end, I have gone to it willingly, gladly—for
my country’s sake.”</p>

<p>She said it quietly, with clear eyes, even faintly
smiling. For many moments he gazed upon her,
for whom life held every good there was, yet counting
self as least of all. And as he gazed, something
of her spirit crossed to him. Personal sorrow,
personal happiness, seemed to grow a minor thing.
Half his pain was swept away, and into him there
thrilled a strange new exaltation.</p>

<p>“It is to do such things, I suppose, that we are
given life,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Her gazed softened, her voice sank to an exquisite
tenderness. “And though I stay, and you go, and
half the world shall lie between us, we are not giving
one another up, dearest. I shall ever be with you.”</p>

<p>“And I with you, my darling!” he breathed.</p>

<p>They talked on, of love, of danger, of what the
future might hold, and then of love again. And
thus their one short hour together sped away, and
the time came when he must go. Their hands
clasped and he looked long, long, into that glorious
face which it might never be his to gaze upon again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
Then he strained her to him.... And then
they parted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Parted, and yet not parted. For in the days when
steam hurled land and sea behind him, and in
those farther days when the fight with his uncle
was on (and a fight it was indeed! as his uncle
had promised), her spirit was as a presence at
his side, giving him new strength and new
courage, making it easier to live humbly and
bravely, and play his part as a man. It was as she
in their last moment had said to him: “We shall
be as husband and wife whom a duty higher than
happiness keeps each in his own land.”</p>

<p>Every day or two, at the pleasure of ocean mails,
there comes a letter, bearing him fresh assurance of
her love. But writ in fear of the censor’s eye, it
gives no hint of what she does, no whisper of what
may be her danger. Of that he can only guess.
And after each such letter he strains to peer beyond
time’s curtain. After each such letter a hope that
will not die breathes daringly in the ear of his heart
that to him may yet be granted the fulness of bliss—that
Freedom may yet be won for Sonya’s people—that
she may come to him!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But, ah—the fear of that to-morrow when the
letters may cease to come!...</p>
